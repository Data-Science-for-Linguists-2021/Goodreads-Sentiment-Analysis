# Goodreads-Sentiment-Analysis
Michael Barmada's Term Project. Sentiment analysis of Goodreads reviews within the Fantasy genre. Examines linguistic differences between positive and negative reviews.

Data was scraped from goodreads.com, specifically from the books found on Goodreads' [fantasy shelf](https://www.goodreads.com/shelf/show/fantasy). The scraper itself was modified from code produced by [Maria Antoniak](https://github.com/maria-antoniak/goodreads-scraper.git)

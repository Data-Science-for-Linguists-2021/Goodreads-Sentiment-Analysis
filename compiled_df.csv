The Way of Kings,5,"I have a Booktube channel now! Subscribe here: https://www.youtube.com/petrikleoIncredible, impressive or fantastic, all these words are an understatement to the quality this book holds. The Way of Kings is the beginning of a masterpiece series in epic fantasy. It is now my life goal and a new addition to my bucket list to obtain and read the entire series of The Stormlight Archive, which will probably take at least another 20 years from now to complete.Before you started reading this book, let me do you a favor. Go outside your home, look at the sky, the stars, clouds, the moon or if you’re brave enough, the sun. Done? Good, raise your expectation of this series that high. My expectation for this book was probably higher than that and it still managed to blow me away. I’m pretty sure the title 
The Way of Kings
 is a hidden message by Sanderson for his reader, telling us that this is his first step in his way of becoming one of the kings in the genre.Obviously, I can’t tell you anything about the story but I’ll tell you this, The Way of Kings is the beginning of tales that will remain inside your mind palace. It’s a heavily character driven book filled with tales of life & death, love & hate, bravery & cowardice, hope & despair, trust & betrayal, faith & atheism. Basically, all elements required for a great story are here, told from multiple POV.Picture: The Way of Kings Characters by 77chenEven though there’s multiple marvelous POV to be found here, each book in the series will focus more specifically on one main character's past; in The Way of Kings, we get to see Kaladin's.Picture: Kaladin by botanicaxu We get to see all his thoughts, life from the past to present, feelings and motivation behind his actions from this book. I’m not saying this lightly but Kaladin has become one of the most well-written characters out of all books I’ve ever read, and definitely one of my favorite of all time out of all medium. Trust me, I’ve seen plenty of fantastic fictional characters throughout my whole life. 22 years of gaming, hundreds of manga read, hundreds of anime watched and Kaladin Stormblessed is definitely one of the best out there.The Way of Kings can be considered a book porn for a lover of world building. Sanderson proved himself once again to be the master of creating worlds out of words.The world, Roshar, are written with intricate description of every single thing in the world; ranging from weather, creatures, history, mythology, magic system, races, culture and even the fucking grass; making this world truly believable. Combined with brilliant, simple and fluid writings plus several detailed maps and beautiful illustrations, the images formed in your head while reading every scene will be so vivid as if you’re really there in Roshar, joining on the adventure with each character.The real actions only happened around three times in the book: prologue, somewhere in the middle and the climax. However, while in total there’s only a total of around 150 pages of actions, the impact of the 60 pages climax sequence of this book was very rewarding. Intense battle sequences, gigantic swords, magic armors & wonderful magic system revival occurred in the climax. It was deeply satisfying as everything in the book built up towards that moment. I’ll admit, I legit almost cried during this section, even though it was predictable, it was done exceptionally.Some may find this book to be really intimidating to start because of the size it has. However, I find that the only con I have for this book is that it’s not long enough. 1004 pages long, filled with 380k words (bigger than the Hunger Games trilogy combined) and by the end of the book, I found that it’s still wasn't enough for me.I’m closing this review with the ancient oath:

“Life before death, strength before weakness, journey before destination.”

I hope my review can do justice to the quality this book holds. It’s really a blessing to have lived and read this book, to have the strength to read and to join in this epic journey of a lifetime together with every reader of the series. If you’re really a fan of the epic fantasy genre, you really can’t go wrong with starting this series. This is the beginning of epic fantasy at its best. Sanderson has created an epic world and journey for us to dive into and all we have to do to experience it is really simple, read the book and let this story lives inside you.

The Way of Kings,3,"A three and a half star read.""What?"" Sanderson's fans say, ""this is a classic!""""What?"" people who read my reviews say, ""you gave the same rating to that mess of a zombie book!""Let me 'splain.No, there is too much. Let me sum up.Ignore comments about the length. I've read books that were as long (hello, The Stand: The Complete and Uncut Edition), and everyone has read series that were over a thousand pages. What troubles me about The Way of Kings is that I felt like I was reading the fantasy equivalent of a walk through The Field Natural History Museum. Thorough. Detailed. Interesting. And equally devoid of action. Put another way: a saltwater fish tank at the Shedd Aquarium (give me a break; I like visiting Chicago's Museum Mile). Watching the sea anemone wave pink arms as the clownfish darts in and out, chasing little bites of fish food. Again, interesting. But worth six hours of undivided attention? Surely you'd want to take a break and watch shark feeding time, right? Wander off to visit the dolphins and the otters?Narrative shifts primarily between three people; Shallan, a penniless noble who wants to apprentice herself to a scholarly heretic, intending to steal her Souljewel; Kaladin, a former surgeon and talented soldier who now wears a slave brand; and Dalinar, a prince and uncle to the king. I appreciated their different viewpoints; Shallan is a naive young woman, Kaladin a member of the underclass and Dalinar is the king's uncle; from all three, we get a remarkable range of insight into the society. This is a slow, thoughtful book, close to the exact opposite of The Alloy of Law, my only Sanderson book to date. He builds a complete world with varied landscapes and an unique social and spiritual culture. I should have loved it, but what I found is a complete absence of grippingness, that take you by the throat experience. The problem? A lack of dynamic tension. Internal tension comes out of the conflicts each of the three main characters are facing, and their indecision at how to act. Thus, about 700 pages are of them gradually backing themselves into a corner and undergoing a personal crisis. Action picks up around page 800 or so. The last three hundred are the most significant and dynamic of the novel and finally had me turning pages in earnest. (For those who are counting, I know it doesn't add up. There are a few sets of random character narratives that build more background and richness--in other words, add pretty backdrop in the dioramas or the coral reefs). The fans argue that it took the building in the first part to create the dynamic tension of the last, but I'd have to disagree. If it takes 700 pages to get to your main conflicts, are those pages story or indulgence?Update 9/7/16: Click for my review on The Author's Notes to Way of Kings: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...Cross posted at http://clsiewert.wordpress.com/wp-adm..."
The Way of Kings,5,"WOW. Ok, so I actually cried during this book (it was a stressful day, but I'm usually not a weeper). This book captures the epic grandiosity and scope that I remember as a kid reading Eddings and Feist and Jordan. I didn't know what was going on all the time, but I was keenly aware of the great plot, the secrets, and the depth of world building and character in this book.Yes, it's REALLY long, and yes, it lags a bit from time to time under all the philosophy, but honestly I was just staggered by the scope of what this book is, and what the rest of this series has the potential to me. I've read most of Sanderson's books (save the Wheel of Time which NEED TO BE READ) but he has really outdone himself with this. BIG FAN TO SAY THE LEAST! If you like big epic fantasy you have to read this."

The Way of Kings,5,Me? Giving a Brandon Sanderson's book 5 stars? sHoCkIng
The Way of Kings,5,"

“In the end, all men die. How you lived will be far more important to the Almighty than what you accomplished.”

This was the best Brandon Sanderson book I’ve read. Since I’ve started reviewing books, everyone constantly talks about Mistborn, which don’t get me wrong, is an amazing series too, but this book blew the entire original trilogy out of the water. I truly believe in my whole heart that The Stormlight Archive series is the series that everyone should be pushing onto high fantasy readers, because it is one of the greatest things I’ve read in my entire life. 

“Don't dream the small dreams of other men.”

The Way of Kings takes place on the world of Roshar, where war is constantly being waged on the Shattered Plains, and the Highprinces of Alethkar fight to avenge a king that died many moons ago. Alethkar is the largest kingdom on Roshar, and the people are called Alethi, and they are at war with the Parshendi, who are almost like bard warriors with their songs and chants. In war everyone pays a price, but some people pay the price way more dearly than others, and The Way of Kings very much showcases that. On Roshar, Highstorms are magical like storms that have shaped this world into something unlike anything else. Highstorms provide Stormlight, which is an energy that the people keep in different gemstones, which has a super vast array of different abilities. And because this story surrounds wars on many different fronts, it makes sense that these Highstorms also helped make some pretty powerful and unique weapon, armor, and even some companions:➽Shardblades - Magical weapons that are very rare and sought after. A person who owns one, a Shardbearer, is soul-bound to their blade. They can cut through pretty much anything, and it instantly kills whatever limb it cuts though, but without leaving a mark. The limb is just rendered useless until it can be reattached to the soul. And Shardblades can block other Shardblades. People constantly want to duel for them, because when a Shardbearer dies, the Blade rematerializes next to him/her, allowing anyone else to pick up the Blade and become its new owner. Yet, it is near impossible to beat anyone with a Shardblade without having one yourself. ➽Shardplate - Magical plate armor that protects the wearer, can heal magically on its own, and enhances the wearers physical abilities. And most importantly, it can block a Shardblade.➽Soulcasting - Soulcasters have the magical ability through fabrials to do many things. Sometimes they use their power to create food, sometimes to heal, sometimes to protect sex workers from gross men at night. I mean, the abilities are actualy endless. But most the time they use their power to change one thing into another, like rocks into food. But the transformations are limited and range from Soulcaster to Soulcaster. Also, needless to say, these people are very sought after. ➽Spren - Also, in this world, they have Spren, which are magical little beings that come in a variety of different types. For example, Rotspren appear when something is beginning to rot, or something is dead, or something is being infected. There are tons of different Spren that take many different forms in this book.But besides the wars and the all of the magic, there is a prejudice war that is constantly going on, too. In this world, having light eyes gives you all the advantages. Blue eyes, green eyes, grey eyes, amber eyes, any kind of light colored eye is superior to any form of dark brown. Some of the higherups in this world believe that the Heralds choose light eyes people at birth and mark them to rule. This is a really big parallel to the world we live in today, and I really liked this aspect of the story and the discussions that surround it. Also, some females in this world are supposed to hide their left hands, and it is considered totally obscene for a woman to have that left hand uncovered. And “lower class” woman just wear a glove over their left hand, while working. I’m sure this will come into play in later books, so I thought I’d mention it, but it still made me giggle at some of the responses to seeing a woman’s bare left hand. And the other unique concept/tradition in this world is that it is “beneath” men (other than ardents) to learn how to read and write. Like, men in this world marry a lot of the time just to be able to have their wives read to them and write down things for them. Yet, this value in society has not only put them at a disadvantage in life, but as also put them at a disadvantage in solving the mystery of the late king’s final act before death. In The Way of Kings, we pretty much follow four main characters, even though three are at the forefront of this book:➽Kaladin - Kaladin seems like the main protagonist of this novel, even though he shares POVs with other characters, but Kaladin makes up the bulk of this 1,000-page novel. Kaladin is branded a slave and is sold into a bridge crew. Yet, Kaladin is such a natural born leader, he ends up shaping Bridge Four into one of the best crews in the entire army. But this doesn’t go unnoticed. Kaladin’s character has a lot of representation. Kaladin is very susceptible to depression, and this book doesn’t skirt around the mental illness. Kaladin is also suffering from extreme PTSD from all the events that have lead him to where he is currently at the start of this novel. We slowly learn about his past; where he came from, who he was supposed to be, who he cared about, and what happened to make him the slave he is now. Trigger warnings for severe depression, suicide, war themes, violence, and gore. 

“How easy it was to ignore a blackened heart if you dressed it in a pressed uniform and a reputation for honesty”

➽Dalinar - Dalinar is a Highprince of Alethkar. His brother was the king, but after his death (you learn this in the prologue) Dalinar has helped raise his nephew, Elhokar, into the king the world needs. Dalinar is also an amazing warrior, and wields the Shardblade Oathbringer (that name sounds familiar, true? *winky face*)! After the night of his brother’s death, Dalinar feels responsibility and is being haunted by it. Dalinar is also seeing visions, and people are questioning his mental stability. He is a widower, but something is blocking him from every remembering his wife’s face or name or any memory of her. And Dalinar has two sons, both in their twenties, that are very different, but he loves them so deeply and so unconditionally. Mostly importantly, Dalinar is a man of honor and he has a grand reputation of always keeping his word and sticking to the rules. ➽Shallan - Shallan had my least favorite chapters, but that was mostly because I wanted to slap her most of the time. She is daughter of the recently deceased Brightlord Lin Davar of Jah Keved. She has come to find Jasnah Kholin, claiming to want to study under her, but actually wanting to steal something from her for the kingdom she left behind. The thing I liked most about Shallan is that she is an artist and it plays a big role into who she is as a person. Plus, a lot of Shallan’s chapter were in libraries with tons of books and it was constantly a beautiful visual. ➽Szeth - Okay, call my weird, but Szeth’s chapters, as few as there were, were my absolute favorite. Szeth is still a very mysterious man, but he wields a Shardblade and knows how to use it to its full abilities. He is known to the world as the Assassin in White and is one of the most feared assassins in the world. From his perspective we get to see the guilt and pain from what he is being forced to do, but who and why he is being forced to repent for his past sins, is a constant mystery. Also, the epilogue chapter of this book, which is in Szeth’s perspective, actually blew my mind. 

“Fighting is not the only thing of value a man can do.”

Yet, this book also has some amazing side characters: ➽Syl - Be still, my heart. Syl is honestly everything I look for in a character to love with my whole being. She is such a little cinnamon roll, and I keep picturing her tripping military dudes in her little invisible form and it just makes me smile for days. Syl is a spren that has bonded with Kaladin. She found him on a night that he needed her most, and has rarely left his side since. And she constantly reminds him that his life is worth living, and what an honorable man he is, and how he isn’t cursed and doomed to lose everyone he loves. Syl is honestly probably my favorite character in The Way of Kings. ➽Jasnah - Jasnah is the daughter of the late King Gavilar and she is the sister of the new king, Elhokar! She is also a very High Scholar and also happens to be a Soulcaster. The Almighty is a deity that is devotedly and widely worshiped on the world of Roshar, yet Jasnah doesn’t. She considers herself a Veristitalian and chooses to put her beliefs in science and the things she can see with her own eyes. The discussion and talk of religion in this book is super well done, and I would have never guessed that Brandon Sanderson, a man that is very open with how much religion means to him, wrote the character of Jasnah. Seriously, it was expertly done. Jasnah is powerful, and smart, and witty, and I think I totally developed a major crush on her. ➽Adolin - But speaking of crushes, apparently, I just love the entire Kholin family! Adolin is Dalinar’s oldest son, cousin to Jasnah and Elhokar, Brightlord of Alethkar, has a very short temper, and is a bit of a flirt. His mother, the one that is passed away and that Dalinar cannot remember, passed down to him full Shardplate, and he won his own Shardblade in a duel. Oh, he loves to duel, too! Adolin is an amazing fighter, who wants to follow in his father’s footsteps, but he is your typical young twenty-year-old that is trying to figure life out, while being constantly reminded that he doesn’t know it all, even though he thinks he does. Adolin loves his family deeply, wants to do what is right, and he just completely won me over. I truly love his character. ➽Renarin - Dalinar’s youngest son, Brightlord of Alethkar, Prince of House Kholin. Renarin is very shy and very quiet, and is not a solider like his father and brother, because he freezes in battle and sometimes has seizures. Brandon Sanderson has also stated that Renarin is on the autism spectrum, which is awesome representation we rarely see in high fantasy. ➽Sadeas - He is also Highprince of Alethkar, along with Dalinar. Dalinar, Sadeas, and the late King Gavilar all grew together and were best friends, yet this book constantly makes you question his loyalty. He is known to be very cruel, and is on the forefront of the war against the Parshendi. ➽Hoid - Okay, I don’t want to talk too much about Hoid, because not everyone is up to date with Brandon Sanderson’s works and the Cosmere Universe. But, this reveal made my year. How Brandon Sanderson continually tricks me, I have no idea. Maybe I’m just a huge sucker. But, like, that flute though. Also, first an interest in Kelsier and now Kaladin? Ahhh, I love Brandon Sanderson so much! I gushed a lot in all the paragraphs above this, so you guys can probably tell I really loved this book. I truly think it is a masterpiece in every sense of the word, and I think this is Brandon Sanderson’s strongest series yet. The discussions in this are important and super eye opening if you look at the parallels to our world today. The characters in this are amazing and a few have really nested themselves inside of my heart. All the magic is so unique and so captivating. The story and plotlines were so addicting. And, on a very personal note, after the Vegas shooting happened I was in a pretty bad headspace. To see my community be impacted by an act of terrorism and pure hatred was something that I don’t wish on anyone. I couldn’t stop thinking and feeling so much sadness, so I binge read the last two hundred pages of this book. Escapism truly is a beautiful thing, and I believe with my whole heart that books are magical entities that have their own healing powers. And I will never forget that The Way of Kings helped me deal with some pretty sad and heavy things going on in my real world.

The Way of Kings,5,My video review https://youtu.be/mDxFNJ1P_ek
The Way of Kings,5,"So, a buddy of mine has been trying to get me into Sanderson for some time (figuratively speaking, I should note...he has not, as of yet, physically tried to jam me inside the poor man, for which, I'm sure, Mr. Sanderson is quite grateful). At my friend's suggestion, I started with Mistborn, which--and don't freak out on me here, Sandersonites--I thought was solid, but didn't exactly salt my pickle (is that a thing?). So, he proceeded to give me The Way of Kings as a gift--his polite way of forcing me to read it. It's been some time since I've plunged into the first volume of a truly door-stopping fantasy series, so it felt a bit like a slog at first. I started to think to myself, ""Self, maybe Sanderson just isn't for you...I mean, you don't have to like EVERY epic fantasy author, you know."" But I kept reading. And then Kaladin started doing awesome things, and I was impatient to get back to his chapters. Only then Dalinar and Adolin started to get compelling. And then I started figuring out what the hell a spren was. And then I started to drool in slack-jawed wonder at the awe-inspiring skill and sheer brainpower involved in conceiving of a world this fully realized. And then there was a little too much focus on jam and bread, but that made sense later. And then, somewhat distractingly, I kept hearing a woad-faced, Scottish-accented Mel Gibson yelling, ""Unite us! Unite the clans!"" every time Dalinar had a flashback. But, I got over that, though I may have giggled on the Metro once or twice (hardly my first brush with inappropriate public giggling in the midst of judgmental commuters). And then crazy, massive, epic things happened, and Big Things were hinted at, and I was hooked.All told, one hell of a ride. I'll be back for more. I just might need a little breather before the second book (even on a Kindle, I almost got a hernia lugging this thing around). Well played, Sanderson--you've won this round."
The Way of Kings,5,"Reread 2020 Bridge 4 is everything! I even own a shirt that says Bridge 4! ****************Re-read on Audible. It was even better the second time around. Shallan's story wasn't as boring this time around. I'm not sure if it was the audio or what, but I'm glad. I'm still in love with Kaladin and I still love Dalinar! Their parts are my favorites even though the whole book is awesome. **First Read Review**I loved how everything in the book came together. Everyone's stories eventually collided into one end game and I loved it! OMG, that ending! I can't believe some of the things that were revealed! I loved Dalinar and his story. I wasn't much into Shallan's story until it got closer to the end. But... Bridge Four... Kaladin... love, love, love. All of the characters were great, but Kaladin is my favorite. He is a great man to do all of the things he did for others and he's bad to the bone on top of that. I fell in love with Rock because he immediately reminded me of Andre the Giant! If they made a movie out of this book and he was still around, perfect fit, perfect!! The majority of the crew on Bridge Four were all awesome and I love how Kaladin brought them all together, the camaraderie was great. Mel 🖤🐶🐺🐾www.melissa413readsalot.blogspot.com"
The Way of Kings,5,"4/29/18: even better the second time. Reviewed by: Rabid Reads4.5 starsI have a new favorite author. His name is Brandon Sanderson. 

This book . . . made me curse like a sailer.If I had tried to read it in public, at the very least, I would have been banned from the property. More likely, I'd have either been locked up for 24-hour observation at the local mental health ward or at the local precinct for Disturbing the Peace, but only after having passed numerous drug tests, proving that I wasn't Drunk and Disorderly.If you think I'm exaggerating, check out my status updates on 
Goodreads
.I am not exaggerating.Honestly, in a book this large, it's nearly impossible to touch on every highlight, so I'm left trying to decide which are the best . . . it's a thankless task, but here goes:Worldbuilding:If it's been done before, I haven't read it, and like Wit said, it's novelty we humans appreciate most.The majority of the world in THE WAY OF KINGS is like a tropical ocean habitat on dry land. Plants retract completely into the ground before a wagon wheel or foot can tread upon them. Instead of cows or oxen pulling those wagons there are ""chulls"" which are over-large hermit crab-sounding things. The monstrous ""chasmfiends"" the nobility hunt for sport are basically giant badass lobsters. Instead of ants or beetles scuttling on the ground, there are ""cremlings"" that sound an awful lot like crawdads. It's kind of awesome.More awesome than that are the people groups.While there were separate and distinct cultures, that wasn't the focus of the differences. The focus was on their Extras: the Alethi who fall into a kind of Berserk warrior state they call the Thrill when they are in battle. Purelakers who can communicate with the fish that fill the waters of their home. Parshendi who grow their own carapace-like armor and have legs strong enough to jump chasms in the Shattered Plains that everyone else needs a bridge to cross. Horneaters who have a kind of fairy sight that allows them to see elemental spren whether the spren wish to be seen or not.I absolutely loved it.Characters:There are so many great characters that I can only give you the gist. These people . . . I wept, but not from sadness, not from loss. I wept b/c my heart could not contain my awe and gratitude and respect for these men, these dregs of society, who one man and one spren had bound together into something so valiant, so courageous, so honorable . . . that I could do nothing but weep. Some people shy away from that sort of thing, and being the kind of person that I am, I view that as its own tragedy. Suffice it to say that if you are a character-driven reader, you will leave this world with a much expanded family.Master of Misdirection:I read this as part of a massive group buddy read (SHOUT OUT to my peeps at 
Sanctum of Fantasy
 (view spoiler)[
  
(hide spoiler)]). Several members achieved ""Master of . . . "" titles during the read, and I'm granting Sanderson Master of Misdirection status.Not only did he expertly paint characters as non-threatening nonentities so that your mind was blown when their nefarious true natures were revealed, but he stealthily laid the groundwork consistently throughout the story, making it utterly believable.But he didn't limit himself to grand scale misdirection, no, he did not. He also regularly made your heart stop for the three seconds it took to get past the obvious reaction to the reality of the situation that was entirely different from the path he had lead you down.*salutes* *fights urge to gesture rudely once back is turned*Moral Ambiguity:The singular complaint I saw voiced during the BR was that there wasn't an identifiable Great Evil that Good needed to triumph over. By the end of the book that was no longer the case, but even before that I didn't mind, b/c Sanderson constantly makes you question: what is right? What is good? It's a deliberate tactic to both make the reader really think about right and wrong, good and evil, and also to eventually make the difference abundantly clear. So if you're the kind of reader that needs that distinction, don't give up, b/c, man alive, you will get it.The last 10%:Sanderson followed a strict formula for the last 10% of his book. It goes like this: 1. What's the worst thing that can happen? Let's do that. 2. How can we make it even worse? Let's do that, too. 3. Now let's make it look like--despite overwhelming odds--everything will work out fine. 4. Now let's crush that hope. Rinse, wash, REPEAT.Part IV will leave you emotionally wrung-out (in a good way), and Part V will give your FEELS a chance to recover whilst blowing your mind (really, your mind should be in pieces by the time you finish).Having just finished yesterday afternoon, I'm surprised that I'm not still in some kind of stupor, but I've prevailed. I did have to step away several times during that last 10% to give myself a chance to recover. I used that time to: order paperbacks of both installments for my dad and hardbacks for myself, b/c these books . . . they deserve shelf space.What kept THE WAYS OF KINGS from being a 5.0 star read were a handful of issues in the beginning of the book. I've been told that WoK was shoved through the editing process to get it into bookstores quickly, and it shows in the repetition of phrases, especially in the prologue. The third time Someone came at Someone Else with ""broad, sweeping strokes"" (of his sword), I was over it. And when an Assassin continually referred to a hallway runner as being red . . . like blood . . . well, despite how fantastic the rest of the book was, I couldn't entirely overlook it's less than stellar start. However, overall . . . again I say, I have a new favorite author.Pre-Review:I'd like to say something simple and profound like, ""I have no words . . . ""Sadly, the truth is that I have too many. Once I've pared them down into something reasonable, we'll be speaking again.In the interim, I shall leave you with these:“Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak!”Draw your own conclusions.My other reviews for this series:

The Way of Kings,2,"When I was a kid, I was never able to get the best of those damned Magic Eye paintings. I would stare and stare until my eyes watered, but to no avail.
  All I see is an OK fantasy novel.
Well, looking at The Way of Kings and its glittering, 4.58 rating is bringing back some painful childhood memories that I’ve tried really hard to repress. Because like those stupid paintings, I just can’t see what all the fuss is about. To be clear, I didn’t hate this book: I thought it was sort of O.K. But this is so out of proportion with what everybody else seems to think that I can’t help but feel out of the loop. It’s Mrs. Betzler’s 4th grade class all over again, so thanks for that Brandon Sanderson. I had three big problems with this book:1. A lot of the action/fighting scenes were pretty tedious. Not once in the book did I feel that any of the main characters were in any serious risk, which sucked away a lot of the dramatic tension. Also, many of characters were so much better equipped/more skilled/blessed with more über magic than their hapless opponents that the battles were just page after page (after page) of the superman characters slaughtering hordes of luckless opponents. At times it felt like I was reading the transcript of somebody playing a video game. A 1,000 page transcript.2. While Sanderson lays some good bricks here in terms of world-building, I never really got hooked by the history of this universe he created, and I didn’t get a great feel for what the world at large was really like (with the exception of a few locations like the Shattered Plains, etc.). That would be one thing if the book was 300 pages, or if it threw us straight into the action, but a book this size where the action is limited had better be doing some grade-A world-building and I didn’t think Sanderson reached that level.3. Finally, your mileage may vary but the writing in this book drove me crazy. I haven’t read anything else by Sanderson, so I don’t know if this is just his style or if there was a failure in the editing process, but I found a lot of the dialogue in this book to be exhausting. For instance:”Brightness…I believe you stray into sarcasm.”“Funny. I thought I’d run straight into it, screaming at the top of my lungs.”Ugh. Or this gem when a young lady requests an unusual book from a merchant:”I can see you are a woman of discriminating taste.”“I am. I do like my meals prepared very carefully, as my palate is quite delicate.”“Pardon. I meant that you have discriminating taste in books.”No. Nonononononono. But I don’t know. If the zingers above made you laugh, or if you like randomly placed exclamation marks in your dialogue, you probably will be just fine. This may just be a matter of personal taste, but the dialogue in this book drove me crazy.Anyway, I don’t want to overstate my dislike for this book. I thought it was long, kind of sloppily written, and could be pretty boring at times. I very nearly quit at about the 450 page mark, which is a rarity for me. But there are some promising elements here: it’s not a Tolkien clone, at least, and some of the characters are pretty solid. Also, the plot got much more interesting as the book developed, and the second half was markedly better than the first (although that’s almost damning with faint praise), to the point that I’ll probably give the second book a chance whenever it comes out. But I sincerely hope it’s better than this one. 2 stars."
The Way of Kings,5,"The Way Of Kings (The Stormlight Archive,#1)Honour, love, and survival. The story is mind-blowing, the ideas and thoughts create a world that is believable and intriguing. A strong tale with a well fleshed out world and multidimensional characters that are easy to care about.  Life before Death. Strength before Weakness. Journey before Destination.Epic!!!!!!"
The Way of Kings,5,"“Life before Death.Strength before Weakness.Journey before Destination.”Fantastic reread of Brandon Sanderson's The Way of Kings! Such a rich history and so much I'd forgotten from my first reading. Planning on continuing the series with a rereading of The Words of Radiance (Stormlight Archive #2). Brandon Sanderson’s Roshar is a world with a rich history, mythologies, magic systems and an ecology which has been shaped by violent (high)storms; this is massive world-building at its best! When you’re reading Way of Kings (Stormlight Archive #1), you’re never sure which details will be relevant later on. Here’s a clue: even though it’s a monster of a book (1,007 pages) almost everything becomes relevant eventually. Am I anxious to read the second book? More like anxious for the third book. In the past few months I’ve read both Way of Kings and Words of Radiance (Stormlight Archive #2) twice (review for Words of Radiance to come soon). I’m ready for Oathbringer (Stormlight Archive #3)!"
The Way of Kings,4,"Actual Rating: 4.5 StarsSo finishing this novel was incredibly bittersweet.The Stormlight Archive is the last of Brandon Sanderson's High Fantasy works I have left to read before I am forced to confront The Great Waiting.However, I am glad I waited to read this series, as it seems like it's going to be one of Sanderson's largest & most clarifying contributions to the Cosmere universe. I had such a wonderful time reading this. I've seen a couple reviewers saying the book could've been shorter (1,007 pages in physical copy, 45.5 hours in audio) but it's not a sentiment I agree with. I believe The Way of Kings would sacrifice vital framework, world building, & characterization were it much shorter.Perhaps the level of immersion present here is not for everyone, but for me, that's part of what makes Sanderson's work stand out in the genre. You can always count on him to transport you directly into his worlds.And what a fantastic setting Roshar is! Literally every aspect of the world, from the unique wildlife to the power of soulcasting & the magical of properties of stormlight, held my rapt attention. I was particularly fascinated by the Alethi dispersion of class & power being based on eye color. This is a concept I've discussed before in my circles of friends, how it is incredibly odd that humans tend to choose arbitrary characteristics to create & define social groupings. Sanderson highlights how foolish it is when we allow our perception of others to be guided by these meaningless lines of division. Race, religion, sexuality, gender. Eye color, skin color, height, weight. We are all people. Individuals with an exponential range of capabilities, and no contrived societal category has the power to determine what we can or cannot achieve. In many ways this book is about having the courage to break free from your prescribed role in life.Once again, we're gonna have to talk about the religious aspects of Sanderson's work. I just appreciate the shit out of what this man does, ok? Throughout the related Cosmere works, characters spanning all across the spectrum of faith appear. The Way of Kings is no exception. What I love so much is that all of these characters are written skillfully with a realistic degree of complexity. They struggle with their choices, they seek validation without always finding it, they are intelligent with the ability to defend their beliefs in the face of opposition. It is so lovely & refreshing to see an author write about a wide variety of belief systems without sacrificing the integrity of any of them. The Way of Kings is full of the concisely descriptive writing & excellent imagination we have come to expect from Sanderson. Specifically I adore the battle scenes/fighting imagery.""The lad was a genius with the blade, an artist with paint of only one shade.""I only had two distinct issues with this novel: 1. The novel is split into a couple different perspectives, but readers spend a disproportionate amount of time with one, a young man named Kaladin. Now, I know this is an unpopular opinion, but I didn't care for how unbalanced the perspectives were. Kaladin's character is fleshed out beautifully, but I wish I could've experienced the same in-depth connection to the other handful of POVs, especially Dalinar & Shallan. There were a couple times I even found myself thinking ""Aw man, another Kaladin chapter."" *waits to get hit by tomatoes*2. This next issue is a bit spoilery! View at your own risk. (view spoiler)[From the very beginning I could not get behind Shallan's plan to rob Jasnah. It just... seemed like a very juvenile plan & I can't imagine agreeing to it if I were part of the conceptual discussion. It sounded to me like the equivalent of trying to rob the President of the United States. Chances are low that I'm going to get away with that, ya know? (hide spoiler)]Otherwise, this is a gorgeously written first novel in what I expect will be a truly epic series. Buddy read with the amazing Kainat!This review and other reviews of mine can be found on Book Nest!"
The Way of Kings,4,"The Way of Kings (The Stormlight Archive #1), Brandon SandersonThe Way of Kings is an epic fantasy novel written by American author Brandon Sanderson, and the first book in The Stormlight Archive series. The novel was published on August 31, 2010. The Way of Kings consists of one prelude, one prologue, 75 chapters, an epilogue and 9 interludes. It was followed by Words of Radiance in 2014. The story rotates between the points of view of Kaladin, Shallan Davar, Szeth-son-son-Vallano, Dalinar Kholin, and several other minor characters, who lead seemingly unconnected lives. Roshar is a world of stone and storms. Uncanny tempests of incredible power sweep across the rocky terrain so frequently that they have shaped ecology and civilization alike. Animals hide in shells, trees pull in branches, and grass retracts into the soilless ground. Cities are built only where the topography offers shelter. It has been centuries since the fall of the ten consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant, but their Shardblades and Shardplate remain: mystical swords and suits of armor that transform ordinary men into near-invincible warriors. Men trade kingdoms for Shardblades. Wars were fought for them, and won by them. One such war rages on a ruined landscape called the Shattered Plains. There, Kaladin, who traded his medical apprenticeship for a spear to protect his little brother, has been reduced to slavery. In a war that makes no sense, where ten armies fight separately against a single foe, he struggles to save his men and to fathom the leaders who consider them expendable. ...تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز دوازدهم فوریه سال 2017میلادیعنوان: طریق شاهان - کتاب نخست در سه جلد - از سری استورم لایت؛ نویسنده: براندن (براندون) ساندرسون؛ مترجم: رضا اسکندری؛ تهران، آذرباد، 1395، در سه جلد؛ شابک دوره سه جلدی 9786006225821؛ کتاب اول قسمت اول 607 ص؛ کتاب اول قسمت دوم 632ص؛ کتاب اول قسمت سوم ؟ ص، هنوز منتشر نشده؛ موضوع: داستانهای خیال انگیز از نویسندگان امریکایی - سده 21مطریق شاهان، حکایتی حماسی از شهامت، شرافت و استقامت است؛ سده ها پس از سقوط ده رسته‌ از سلحشوران، موسوم به «شوالیه‌ های پرتوافکن»، شمشیرها و زره‌ های سنگی‌شان (موسوم به جنگ‌ افزارهای شارْد)، همچنان بین انسان‌ها دست به دست شده، و صاحبانشان را به سلحشورانی شکست‌ ناپذیر، و فراانسانی بدل می‌کند؛ تمامی جنگ‌ها با محوریت شمشیرزنان سنگی، و زره‌ پوشان سنگی درگرفته، و به دست آنان به پیروزی می‌انجامند؛ در یکی از جنگ‌ها، که در دشتی موسوم به دشت «هزار تکه»، در جریان است، برده‌ ای به نام «کالادین»، در تلاش برای نجات جان هم‌بندی‌های خویش، به تفکرات رهبران ده سپاه (که در جنگ، برده‌ ها را موجوداتی مصرفی می‌پندارند) پی می‌برد؛ «لُرد دالینار»، رهبری یکی از ده سپاه را، برعهده دارد؛ او شیفته‌ ی یکی از متون باستانی، با عنوان «طریقِ شاهان»، و اسیر پنجه‌ ی اوهامی‌ است از دوران باستان، که ذهنش را تحت سلطه‌ ی خود درآورده‌ اند؛ وضعیت او، به حدی رو به وخامت می‌گذارد، که حتی به سلامت عقل خود نیز، مشکوک می‌شود؛ در همین گیرودار، در آنسوی اقیانوس، دختری جوان، با نام «شالان»، تحت نظارت پژوهشگری برجسته، و بدنام، برادرزاده‌ ی «دالینار»، «جاسنا»، به تعلیم دیدن مشغول است؛ اگرچه «شالان» از صمیم قلب شیفته‌ ی یادگیری‌ است، نقشه‌ ای شوم در سر دارد؛ پژوهشهای وی و «جاسنا»، به کشف رموزی، درباره‌ ی شوالیه‌ های باستانی پرتوافکن، و همچنین دلیل اصلی جنگ طولانی، در دشت «هزار تکه» می‌انجامد؛نقل از متن: «تو من را به گستاخی در کندوکاوم متهم میکنی؛ تو من را به پافشاری به کینه ام نسبت به رِیز و باوادین متهم میکنی...؛ در هر دو مورد حق با توست.؛ «کالادین» روی کف ارابه ایستاد، و زمینهای خارج از اردوگاه را تحت نظر گرفت، تا در همانحال راک و تِفت نقشه اش را (مطابق برنامه) به مرحله ی اجرا بگذارنددر شهر خودشان، هوا خشکتر از این بود؛ اگر یک روز قبل از اَبَر طوفان به مناطق خارج شهر میرفتید، همه ی زمینها خشک و بایر به نظر میرسید و پس از طوفان، گیاهان خیلی زود به داخل پوسته ها، تنه ها و مخفیگاههایشان میرفتند تا جلوی از دست رفتن آبشان را بگیرند؛ اما اینجا که اقلیم شرجی بود، گیاهان نیازی به مخفی شدن نداشتند؛ قطعات زمین چمن، در اینجا و آنجا به چشم میخورد، و گیاهانی با تنه های قطور به شکل مایل به سمت غرب میروییدند و ریشه های ضخیم انگشت مانندشان را، به داخل سنگها فرو، و به مرور زمان، سنگهای اطرافشان را ترک داده و خُرد میکردند کالادین از ارابه پایین پرید؛ کارش این بود که سنگها را بلند و روی کفه ی ارابه بگذارد سایر خدمه سنگها را میآوردند و در کنار ارابه توده میکردندخدمه در میان تخته سنگها، علفها و بوته ها حرکت میکردند؛ اغلب گیاهان در سمت غرب، تراکم بیشتری داشتند و آماده بودند که با وقوع ابرطوفان به داخل مخفیگاهشان بخزند؛ گویی هر تخته سنگ، سر یک مرد سالخورده بود که گُله های موی سبز و قهوه ای از پشت گوشهایش روییده باشد؛ این گُله ها اهمیت زیادی داشتند، چرا که در میان آنها گیاهانی با برگهای نازک به نام نابْ وید میرویید که خاصیت ضدعفونی کنندگی داشتکالادین سنگی را بلند کرد، آن را روی کف ارابه گذاشت و به سمت سنگهای دیگر هُل داد؛ کف سنگ به خزه و لجن آغشته بودناب وید جزو گیاهان نادر نبود، اما همانند سایر علفها هم به وفور یافت نمیشد؛ تنها یکبار توصیف مشخصات ظاهری آن برای راک و تِفت کافی بود، که بروند و چندتایی از آن پیدا کنند؛ البته موفقیت بزرگ زمانی حاصل شد، که سیل هم به گروه تجسس پیوست؛ کالادین همچنان که برای برداشتن سنگی دیگر خم میشد، به طرف دیگر نگاه کرد؛ سیل، در هیبت یک نوار کم نور به این سو و آن سو میرفت و راک را در یافتن بوته های ناب وید یاری میکرد؛ تِفت هیچ متوجه نمیشد که چطور آن هورن ایترِ تنومند میتوانست آنقدر بیشتر از او ناب وید پیدا کند، و البته کالادین هم نیازی نمیدید وجود سیل و قابلیت دیدنش توسط راک را برای تِفت توضیح دهد؛ اصلاً خودش هنوز نمیدانست که چطور راک میتواند سیل را ببیند؛ راک میگفت این قابلیت از بدو تولد با او بوده است»؛ پایان نقلتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 18/09/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی"
The Way of Kings,2,"We have the freedom to express our opinions in beauty of subjectivity, and we should always fight and bite to keep that. But that's not the case I'm trying to make here with this review. I’m not trying to challenge anyone’s opinion or common sense when I say that by all measures of literature in history of mankind – and what paved the way for books, movies, songs we today call classics to be considered as such because of their unique quality – The Way of Kings (as well as its far worse sequel: Words of Radiance) is one of the worst books ever written.I tried as much as I could to share my thoughts in a thoughtful and respectful manner for all of you who love this book. And I believe that I do have an actual position (as an admirer of fantasy genre) that I feel obliged to argue. Especially when I see a problem.OK? OK. Onto the actual review, then. The only book I’ve read more times than this one was 
Leo Tolstoy’s War and Peace.
 And the reason why I read War and Peace so many times was because upon each read I discovered something new that would grip me in Leo’s story; a new character and their perspectives I overlooked or experienced in a different way every other time I took the book in my hands. A true masterpiece and a classic that rightfully stands against the time, in spite being written well over a century ago.Am I actually trying to draw a comparison between War and Peace and The Way of Kings? God, no!The only similarity these two books have, luckily, is that both are just that – books. In everything else they fail in comparison.But, I have seen many people calling The Way of Kings both a masterpiece and an instant classic of the genre. I admit, on my first two reads, I was inclined to agree. I understand all of you who think and say that. Because I was one of you. I was enamored and infatuated by scope and magnitude of what I was reading. I never thought that someone could make a story where people are fighting over a heart of a giant crab and make it sound serious.I never thought that you could read about bunch of knights, dressed as medieval 
Power Rangers,
 wielding giant swords that were made out of pure essence, which would appear in their hands out of thin air (or morning mist) when they would call them with their minds – and not come out as a dork high on sugar.
It was important to me because I was one of those dorks high on sugar.
I thought – what most of you are right now quite unimaginatively repeating in unison – that this book was exclusively nothing but: amazing. Now? 
I’m deeply ashamed of myself for having such a high opinion of this book.
So, what happened in-between my first two reads in 2011 and 2012 and this one at the end of 2017?Well, the answer is quite simple: 
I read better books than this one.
 Better books with richer worlds, more beautiful prose and far more developed characters. Better series with less inconsistencies in it, less plotholes and less… well, problems overall.Better authors that were more focused on quality of what they were writing about - where you can actually recognize their effort to make a book better; than quantity - when after first two reads and beginners infatuation by the scope and magnitude of what you were dealing with, few years later when you try to reread what you, in your ignorance, were believing was an ‘instant classic’, is nothing more than a shallow, 800 pages far too long, rambling. So, the actual rating for this book is 2.25/5.How come exactly 2.25? Well, because of the chart. This one:And the long list of problems that prevented numbers on that chart from going higher. What problems?Let’s start with the biggest one for me. 

Characterization.

The fun starts, with - what I will repeat is - probably one of the best described confusion of battle I have ever read. Anywhere. And whoever experienced a battle in real life, or at least played 
CoD
 online, or really, really carefully was trying to figure out what baseball is about, probably knows of confusion I’m talking about. (And if you’re wondering, yes, I experienced all three above – baseball is the worst. By far.)It’s a really great scene where you are put in this situation where you don’t have any knowledge of terrain, where you are depraved of ‘bird’s perspective’ in which you can 'see' battle on the east flank, or what happens on the west side, so that you can act accordingly. No, here, all you can see are sweating bodies; hear yelling and cursing; and smell gore and piss. You’re a puppet, you know you’re a puppet, and like one, they move you all around.And in this chapter we are introduced to our main protagonist. Our 
Jesus,
 our 
Superman
 of the story. With his almost omnipotent power he’s expressing, he tries to take care of those who can’t do that for themselves, and you can see in his saddened gaze – which is due to undoubtedly his equally sad and tragic past – weight of the entire world, threatening to crash him underneath. Yet he stands. Resolute.Until the next chapter where we see him in shackles, with broken spirit, strolling away as a slave to 
Shattered Plains,
 where he will carry bridges into war across the chasms, towards revolution and freedom for all!(Now insert a petty sarcasm ""over 6000"" here):Nooo, I have 
never
 seen a character such as this! It never, ever, crossed my mind that 
Kaladin
 (our main protagonist) is a Jesus and Superman in one, with 
Peter Pan’s Tinkerbelle (Syl) 
 on his shoulders as, not just as a moral compass, but a source of his powers to, let’s say, I don’t know, maybe even fly…And yes, I’m ashamed of this as well, because it took me two reads to realize similarities between Peter Pan and Tinkerbelle and Kaladin and Syl.So, now that we are on Shattered Plains… wow, wow, wow, wow… where are you going? You thought we were moving forward? No, no, no, no, this book doesn’t work like that. No…In order for us to move forward with characterization of our main protagonist, we have to go: back. Into the 800 pages long info-dumps. Oh yes. 
Oh no!
 Ramifications of this atrocity called: ‘characterization through characters past’ will be significant in future.First two books of 
The Stormlight Archive
 series are the most dangerous thing that happened to this genre.In 50 years, when historians will bang their heads in an effort to find roots of a downfall of epic fantasy as a genre, they’ll find its roots here. In this very book.It started already. Just this year alone I have read two books by an author who said he was inspired by 
Brandon Sanderson.
 And he did this exact same thing. He build a character by telling his past.And… do you know what some of you who read those books said about that approach of building a character? You called it an info-dump.It’s really interesting how you failed to recognize and you actually praised that same approach here, where that kind of fallacy practically came from. Oh well…Who knows how many of new, aspiring authors will be inspired by this kind of approach.All because none of us told Sanderson that THIS - DOESN'T - WORK.‘So what’, you’ll say. ‘Surely there’s no a definitive answer what characterization is or isn’t.’Except, there is. There are books actually written about it. With carefully dissected examples of what throughout the history of literature and media all around us today, worked as a story, plot or characterization and, more importantly, what didn’t worked.And when I compared those examples of undoubted quality in long history with what Brandon tried here with, not just his characters but overall, in this book, it’s really not that much of a surprise that The Way of Kings doesn’t stand to a test of time. Not even three years passed when I noticed first problems, when I read more than 100 books of this genre and realized: ‘Oh my God, there are far better books than this one.’. In essence, my problem with Kaladin’s characterization is this. You can show a character going through many changes in a story, but not all of them represent character change.True character change involves a challenging and changing of basic beliefs, leading to new moral action by the hero.What happens when we exclude stories about his past (those infamous info-dumps), stories that tells us how Kaladin’s character was shaped and came to be to the point where we meet him in his first chapter? Let's ask ourselves a question:
Who exactly is Kaladin when we meet him for the first time?
A capable young man who cares deeply about people in his unit, people he feels responsible for due to his tragic past. And he is willing to negotiate and work with people with whom he fundamentally disagrees. Lighteyes.
Who is Kaladin at the end of the book?
A capable young man who cares deeply about people in his unit, people he feels responsible for due to his tragic past. And he is willing to negotiate and work with people with whom he fundamentally disagrees. Lighteyes.Spot the differences there?No?Didn't think so.Let’s say I’m a potter. And I have a vase I want to reshape into something else. I start turning the wheel, reshaping and reshaping it – only to end up with a same vase again.Question is: why? Why spending my time, my efforts and my resources reshaping something into exactly the same thing it was in the first place?  And one can maybe argue: ‘Well, it’s the journey, not the destination.’If the entirety of a journey is simply running in circles, then I’ll accept that. Because that’s exactly what happened here. Kaladin started from point 'A', went into journey of self-doubt and self-preservation, only to end up back at the same point 'A' he begin with. And that’s absolutely fine. Those are all changes. But that’s not characterization.Brandon keeps repeating this same mistake throughout this entire series.And do you know why I gave characterization of this book 2 and not 1?Apply all of which I've said about building Kalladin's character to a character of 
Adolin Kholin.
Who he is at the beginning and the end, moral conflicts that shaped his character inside of one cohesive story etc...Vast improvement.And do you know whose character is one constantly good thing throughout these five reads?Adolin Kholin, yes.Wonder why is that...About female characters I'll say only this: When you insist on copying female characters you created in 
Elantris
 and 
Warbreaker,
 and simply paste them from next series to next - I will call you on it. 
Sarene, Siri, Vivenna, Shallan
 and 
Jasnah
 are all one and the same character.You make me miss that 
Mistborn's
 very own Mary Sue: 
Vin.
And just to be clear, female characters are not the only ones that get this unimaginative treatment.We have this reminiscent sidekicks:
Teft.
 A blindly devoted, desperate in need of worshiping someone 
Galladon
 from Elantris knock-off. Yes, Teft from The Way of Kings serves exactly the same purpose for main character in this book as did Galladon for main character of Elantris.Now, we only need someone who'll, like Galladon in Elantris, constantly repeat nonsense in a local dialect... something like sule or kolo...Ah, 
Lopen,
 there you are! Yes, gancho, you, get over here, gon!I swear I see a pattern here...

Worbuilding.

I want to express gratitude for immense amount of effort Brandon’s team put up into creating artwork for this book. It’s really amazing, from cover itself, through maps to interior art.Just look at this map:Just look at it. Such beauty to look upon. Only to look upon, because, sadly, out of all of that, for almost two entire books we’ll spend time only on eastern barren cliffs.So, this glorious, beautiful map? You don’t need it. For two books you’ll experience three percent of it. (Red X marks the spot)
Cliffs. Chasms and giant crabs.
1100 pages long behemoth of a book and we’re left wondering not just how 97% of the world looks like, but also how society works on some basic levels.But I guess it was far more important to tell us that alcohol comes in variety of colors. And tease some cameo appearances in interludes that, as of yet, don’t serves to the main story.

Prose.

I passionately disagree with this logic how “If you’re not a writer and if you’re not eloquent enough in writing your own reviews” you shouldn’t criticize author’s prose.Do I need to be a mechanic to say that my wheel has fallen off?Do I need to be a firefighter to say that my house is burning?No?So why do I need to be a writer myself to recognize and say that author of this book is preposterously bad at writing.It’s either that, or he considers me an idiot. I do have self-respect, so I’ll go with the first one.Brandon Sanderson is lightyears behind those authors I consider decent ones.And mind you, English is not my first, nor second language, but still I’m able to recognize vastness in differences between authors prose. It’s not really science.And if we combine his fetish of constant repeating and reminding us that 
Jasnah
 (written with a J but spoken with a Y – as I said, illiteracy cuts deep in this one) is a heretic and that 
Sadeas
 lacks 
Shardblade,
 at least three times per chapter with boring, witless and cringeworthily dialogues - novel is unbearably bleak and blatantly ridiculous.Just a few examples: Sadeas and his far too many times now mentioned Shardblade:
""Sadeas's hand had gone to his sword. Not a Shardblade, for Sadeas didn't have one.""""The highprince hated that Adolin had a blade while Sadeas had none""""Sadeas was calling for his grandbow.""
Remember, this is all within a single 15 pages long chapter. Second - dialogues. Those awful, awful dialogues:
“I can see you are a woman of discriminating taste.”“I am. I do like my meals prepared very carefully, as my palate is quite delicate.”“Pardon. I meant that you have discriminating taste in books.”“I’ve never eaten one, actually.”
As well as pitiful attempts at witty banters and humor:
""Each man has his place. Mine is to make insults. Yours is to be: in-sluts.""
Barum tssss....And my favourite, Sanderson's signature over-the-top bullshit:
""Today I went fishing and I caught one. Very lucky fish other fisherman said. Cures aching joints for a good month after you eat it, and sometimes let you see when friends were going to visit by letting you read the shapes of the sound.""
I mean, at this point, why the hell not?

Allegory.

Nonexistent. OK, Sanderson fans, what is this book about? What is the meaning, what is he trying to say, what’s the message?Is this book about racism? Criticizing it? I hope so. Because in this book, everyone is racist. Including Kaladin, our main protagonist. What? And how would you call a person who because of actions of two people with distinctive physical characteristics now hates everyone with those same physical characteristic?That's a definition of racist. And that's also Kaladin's POV.But, he's not the only one, no. Lighteyes people are basically Nazis. They hate anyone non-lighteye.Darkeyes people, or a common folk, of course, hate lighteyes and, because society thought them that way, they hate these slaves, these Parsh people.Parshendi, which are equivalent to Native American people... well, they hate everyone. Including themselves.And since everyone, Lighteyes, Darkeyes and Parshendi hate Parsh people, people who did no harm to anyone else, and who literally serve as slaves in this book - it only fits to make them as main villains, right?I told you this book is filled with Sanderson's over the top bullshit, didn't I?It’s a paradox how the only compliant and peaceful in collective discrimination of their race are mute, black 
Parsh
 slaves which aren’t even consider as humans. But like that wasn’t enough in this, ocean of ridiculousness, by the end of this book they are proclaimed as story’s main antagonists. Empty vessels that could be filled with nothing but evil spirits.And on top of that, you'll add Shallan, our female lead, who'll say something along these lines:
""Oh, but maybe they don't actually want to be free.""
Thank you and goodnight.All in all, I understand everyone who likes this book and this series. It's just that I have read better books in my life, since my first read of this one. And the way I'm looking at reading books and what I seek in them - The Way of Kings simply doesn't provide anymore.It's a shame he got lazy in creating these worlds. But given how his readers will glorify everything he does, he would be crazy not to exploit that. Oh well..."

my eyes are bleeding, my head is pounding, my crops are withering but i made it through this book and that's all that really mattersso, i want us to be adults and sit and talk about our thoughts on this book with maturity and understandingthat being said, i ALMOST 3 STARRED THIS IM SO SORRY PLS DONT HURT MEallow me to explainsourcestory & plotso the story in itself, is great, fantastic, marvelous.brando sando is a high fantasy writer like no one else, he creates worlds and magic system that are diverse and strong and incredibly well-developed. i appreciate that his magic systems follow guidelines and aren't haphazard in their correlation (even if i dont understand what's happening most of the time)my issue with his storytelling, in this book, was that there's SO MUCH going on. me and my 3 brain cells had a hard time processing, keeping track of, and absorbing the contents of this book while remaining sane (my brain was basically an alarm bell that kept screaming !!!OH MY GOD THIS IS REALLY 1000 PAGES!!! everytime i looked to see what page i was on) writingbrando's writing is generally very easy to understand and digest. while you are thrown into everything at once, it's usually from the perspective of characters who are ALSO clueless as you, so you're learning together (yay)my MAIN ISSUE WITH THE ENTIRE BOOK WAS THE PACINGmy goodness it REALLY didn't need to be over 1000 pages long. it really didn't. come at me with your pitchforks and spears, i will continue to speak the truthokay, for realsies, the middle portion of the book dragged onnnnnn for no reason. we were re-experiencing scenes over and over and over and i didn't feel like they added any extra dimension to the book, other than making my arms ache from holding the bookit disconnected me from the story and made it really difficult for me to push through bc THE AMOUNT OF PAGES LEFT WERE STILL TOO MUCHi honestly, think, in my oh-so-very professional opinion, that the book could have been 500 pages less and it would hold the same impact 🤭sourcecharactersi ADORED the characters. kaladin and shallan are my favourites without a doubt. i love them, i want to protect them, i want to adopt them.sourcekaladin my soft sad little boi. he's had such a tragic and difficult past and yet he's an inspiration. i love how real his character felt, the constant struggle he had with trying to survive but also the huge waves of hopelessness that would take overhe's such a deep and complex character and i love his relationship with syl and bridge 4THAT BEING SAID, i feel like his chapters were the most repetitive.look, i loved spending time around the pot and waiting for stew with bridge 4 but OH MY GOD SOME CHAPTERS WERE JUST COMPLETE COPIES OF PREVIOUS ONESmy eyes did not appreciate thatmoving on.sourceshallan and jasnah = 👌i found their chapters (while hard to come by) the most entertaining and exciting to read. there was a build of political intrigue, but the characters and their personal lives were really the main focus.jasnah takes NO crap from anyone and i just LOVE that about her character. shallan, is me. she draws, she's awkward, she finds herself in difficult social situations, she hides from the sun??? wow you basically laid out my resume her motives and actions, the way her character developed and grew and her plot line, i thought it was the most thrilling to read.sourcedalinar's chapters kinda turned into a snooze-fest for me UNTIL things started making sense and then, i chose to stan. i really like his character and how he is this fatherly figure. he's so good. like he's just a GOOD, GENUINE, MORAL GUY JUST TRYING TO LIVE HIS LIFE AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THATi'm really excited to learn more about his past and follow the lives of his sons (who i assume are going to play a greater role in the coming books). they are all so well developed and left off at a place that could expand in SO MANY ways AND I CANT WAIT TO SEE WHAT'S IN STOREendingouft, that ending. look, i was sincerely going to 3 star up until the last 100 pages. i was having a really hard time finding something magical about the book. to me, it was a good fantasy with great characters, but one that was badly paced (😶) and finally, the end came through and saved it for me bc i was about to get exiled from the book community. the reveals, the betrayals, the twists, the magic, i just LOVE when all those aspects come together and deliver a Solid conclusion in conclusion, i still stan brando and will be picking up the second book soon bc that ending left me excited for what's to come. and can we get more happy kaladin :( i just want him to be happy againi had so much more to say but im tired and forgetful, so this review is terrible and i have no idea what i'm saying but eh, i hope you enjoy the beautiful fanarts c:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~every pushup, every bicep curl, every ring on the monkey bars 
(that's a joke, i can't climb the monkey bars)
, have all led me to this moment. don't let me down now, arms. in all honesty, this book is FREAKING HUGE and i know it's going to physically and mentally crush me and i am Scaredbut here we go anyways"
The Way of Kings,4,"”Life before death. Strength before weakness. Journey before Destination. Speak again the ancient oaths and return to men the Shards they once bore. The Knights Radiant must stand again.”It has been ages since the legendary Knights Radiant stood against the Voidbringers. Now all that remains of them are the Shardplates and Shardblades they once wore. The world of Roshar has descended into a place of murder and intrigue, and while assassins kill kings in the shadows of the night, war rages on the Shattered Plains, where the Highprinces of Alethkar fight to avenge their fallen leader.The Stormlight Archive is one of the most ambitious projects in fantasy today. A 10-book series consisting of 1000-page long books is not something to scuffle at. And it also provides the explanation for the weaknesses of this book.All right. I'll save the praise for later, and go straight to the negative things first. I’m going to have to completely and utterly agree with what I have been reading in a tremendous amount of reviews for The Way of Kings: this is a 1000-page prologue. And there is no plot development. That sentence is of course mostly me shamelessly exaggerating, but it doesn’t hide the fact that this is one of the slowest books I have read in a long, long time. It could have been cut to the half without losing anything of importance. After finishing the book, you realise that the characters are more or less at the exact same point as where they started. Except that they’ve grown as characters. And that’s this book in a nutshell. Plot development is virtually non-existent, while character development is the main focus of the book.I should also mention my feelings about Kaladin. Several of my friends have told me that he would probably end up being my favourite character. And I couldn’t disagree more. Kaladin is a complex character all right. He has his ghosts of the past, he has his problems to overcome, and he’s very emotional. But as a young, male human protagonist, he’s not exactly special. On the contrary, I considered Kaladin a boring character. I did not hate him, and I did not think he was a bad character, but he was boring me. His chapters were in my eyes the most boring ones, his characters was in my eyes the most boring among the protagonists. And the fact the he is supposed to be the main protagonist of this first book didn’t exactly help. I know that many of you really enjoy reading about Kaladin, and I have no problem with that, but his character and storyline just didn’t appeal to me at all. So far.So why do I give this such a high rating? Because I’m afraid of Sanderson cultists with ropes and torches coming for me? No, actually not. Well, perhaps, but… I really liked this book. The worldbuilding is interesting, the characterisation and character development is amazing, and so is mostly everything else. There is absolutely nothing that is outright bad in this book. It’s just a mix of awesome things and… not so awesome things.A few specific strengths: firstly, female characters. From what I’ve read so far, female characters make up one of Brandon Sanderson’s great weaknesses. Well, he kind of fixes that impression in this book. Shallan is in my eyes a much better protagonist than Vin and Siri, and she doesn’t even come close to the two fascinating princesses of House Kholin: Jasnah and Navani.“The purpose of a storyteller is not to tell you how to think, but to give you questions to think upon.”Secondly, morality and ambiguity. Sanderson is good at creating religions and faiths, and he’s good at making the reader think. The book addresses several important philosophical and ethical issues, and comes up with arguments for all viewpoints.Thirdly, the Knights Radiant. When reading fantasy, I have a fascination for nostalgia and legends from the forgotten past. Finding out more about them was part of my motivation for going on reading even in the most boring of Kaladin’s chapters.""It was as if, for Dalinar Kholin, wearing his Plate was his natural state—it was the times without that were abnormal. Perhaps that was one reason he’d earned the reputation of being one of the greatest warriors and generals who ever lived.”Fourthly, Dalinar Kholin. I did not like Kaladin (didn’t dislike him either, mind you), I was mostly indifferent to Szeth, and while Shallan was a cool enough girl, she’s not the type who becomes my favourite. Dalinar the Blackthorn, however, is probably the greatest character Sanderson has created so far. He’s an aging general advising his royal nephew in the ways of war, and struggles to unite young Alethkar and forge it into a unified kingdom.Everything else I liked mostly has to do with Dalinar. His relationship with Navani, his sister-in-law and former love, is fantastic. His relationship with Highprince Sadeas, the old friend who became a rival, even more so. I have a fascination for reading about enemies or rivals cooperating, and Dalinar and Sadeas was a perfect example of just that. And so Dalinar, his honour and his interactions make this book into a way more enjoyable experience than it could ever hope to be without him.Last, but not least, I should say that the last ten chapters (approximately) were fully worthy of five solid stars. The actions of Dalinar and Kaladin in the heat of battle, several brilliant plot twists and a nice, little epilogue that was probably the best single chapter in the whole book. And there, at the very end, the prologue with the ridiculous length is turned into the beginning of what has the potential to become a legend of the fantasy genre. This was a great fantasy novel. Just not among the very best. The series as a whole, however, has the potential to rise up there.*phew* That was a lot of thoughts, and the longest review I've written in a while. Actually, there may be more to come, but for now, this is it.I'll finish off with a little quote I really enjoyed from an amazing character I haven't even mentioned in the review:”This world, it is a tempest sometimes. But remember, the sun always rises again.”"
The Way of Kings,4,"Holy mother of long walks to a short drink of water.Now, before you murder me for opening with a phrase that implies ill things about our Lord and Savior Branderson, hear me out. The Way of Kings has a thousand pages. A thousand. That's one hell of a long walk. Other authors have set up and resolved whole sagas in less than a thousand pages, brilliant sagas. SO, when I commit to a book that's longer than my average book series, I expect some serious action and drama. This book falls a bit flat in that respect. We're introduced to so many fascinating characters, fantasy concepts, and plotlines, but it's barely a glimpse. This world is so complex even a thousand pages can do no more than introduce a reader. So I commend Branderson for having the creative capacity to dream up a world like this - he's a genius. However.It's hard trudging through 75 full-length chapters with the constant feeling that you've still only scratched the surface of the story, like it will take 3 or 4 more doorstopper installments for all the people and concepts to make sense. Introducing unexplained elements to a fantasy world is a fun way for an author to keep readers on their toes, but in small doses please. I don't want to spend another thousand pages feeling vaguely confused, telling myself that if I just stick with the series everything will become clear eventually. That being said, Branderson is still a gift from the Honor and I'll read literally anything he publishes without a second thought. Seriously, I'd pay to read his grocery lists. ---------------------------------------------------------------Me trying to finish this plus Words of Radiance PLUS Edgedancer before the release of book 3 while also coping with midterms and other BRs:"

The Way of Kings,3,"17/25 (68%) 3 stars.----Original review: I tried. I really tried, so incredibly hard to like this book. Everybody kept writing how good Sanderson was, under all those Rothfuss and Martin books I’m longing for. „Read Sanderson, he’s good and he delivers regularly.“ So I tried.God, I’ve never wanted to like a book as much as this one. I was looking forward to more than a thousand pages of fantasy, so when I finally held it, I immediately started reading. Reading. Reading... and fighting through every word, every sentence, every single page, although I felt like I was Sysiphos who’s pushing his rock up that mountain. So people: I really tried. I read 200 pages of it and that was when I couldn’t take it anymore, because I realised I’d read 200 - TWO HUNDRED - pages and I still had no idea what this was about. I didn’t like a single character, I didn’t understand a single character, and the world didn’t appeal to me. At all. So I stopped.Today I tried again. I tried to give it a second chance, so I grabbed this book from the top of my shelf where it has mostly been lying around for the last months, collecting dust and serving as a nice reminder that there’s a book within my flat which I have not read. I couldn’t stand that, so I tried again. You should give people a second chance, and so I thought, although it was a huge disappointment up to this point: you gotta give it a second chance. This is a book which a lot of people have written enthusiastic reviews about and they all write that it’s getting better and better. So I read the next chapter about Nan Balat.I read this chapter about a main character‘s brother who cracks open and kills crabs while watching his hound kill other animals. Four pages of it that have given nothing to the story, have given no insight into Nan Balat or any other character, and have as far as I know not served a single purpose other than filling four pages. So, no. For the first time in my entire life, I won’t finish a book. This book. I’ve read through over 200 pages of it and it’s been boring, full of repetitions and pointless scenes. So from my point of view: even if the other 800 pages are better than anything I’ve ever read, I won’t read them, because I strongly believe that an author shouldn’t be allowed to write over 200 pages of nothing. And I absolutely don’t believe that these 800 pages are any better, because apart from the non-existent plot, the storytelling and writing were absolutely not to my taste. This book felt just boring and loveless. So: 1 star. And not a single more.----------EDIT 1: Okay. So. I'm currently binging Brandon Sanderson's amazing lecture on how to write scifi and fantasy on his youtube channel so I feel like I'm morally indebted to give this one another try. Also I'm just not able to live with having not finished a book. Don't judge me, I'm weak.————-Edit 2: I’ve read the Mistborn trilogy in December and as I liked it and now know what type of narrator Sanderson is, I’ll give this one another try in February.----Edit 3: Well, February is here and I gave it another go. As you can see, my rating has improved, but I'll still leave my original review up here because it's a wonderful reflection of what many people may think about this book when they haven't read anything by Sanderson before. So. Was my second read of this better? Hell, yes. In fact, things didn't improve only after those 208 pages this time, but I had a better experience right from the start because I was already used to all the different names, magic systems, and spren flying around. So this turned into a pageturner - I've read this in four days in between exams, which obviously shows that this was a smooth read after all. And yet, my critique regarding its plot stands. Is this a bad book? No. Is this a book that needed to have 1250 pages? Also no. Yes, you need a solid groundwork for a ten-book series. But these are far too many words for the bit of plot that actually happens. Also, I kept waiting for the big Sanderlanche, for things suddenly getting epic and action-packed and... it never really happened. Yes, there's this big battle, but still. I'm used to the incredible endings of the three Mistborn books, so this was something of a disappointment. And Nan Balat? Still pointless.It sums up to: it was okay. Sanderson's worldbuilding is as spectacular as usual, but so far, Lashings, spren, and stormlight aren't as interesting or as awesome as Allomancy. I guess all of this was needed for stuff that eventually happens in the sequels, but I'm not here to talk about the sequels which I'll pick up eventually. I'm rating this book on its own and while I don't think its a terrible failure anymore, I still don't love it. ----Dialogue 3Setting 4Characters 4Writing Style 3Plot 3"
The Way of Kings,2,"Pops in Ride of the Valkyrie and sharpens battle axe to fend off Sanderson fans.I'm sorry The Way of Kings; it's not you, it's me. Well, it's kind of you, but mostly me.DISCLAIMER: I'm not saying this is a piece of trash and that you have to be dumb to like it. I'm saying this this book failed my personal tastes. All of my dislikes are completely due to personal preference.I've picked this book up and put it back down again, with the intention of never picking it back up, 18 times now. I've only finished once out of all those times, mainly due to pure stubbornness. I wanted to try again because I really couldn't remember what happened, as I was hoping to try Words of Radiance out. Now I'm not so sure. But I feel I've given this book way more than enough chances at the hopes of liking it. So here are my honest thoughts. I had to DNF at 80%. I know, I know, that's the best part. Well, you see, that's sort of the problem. I just didn't care about the outcome. Mainly because I've read this once and already know what happens, but mainly I just couldn't care less. But I'll save all of that for the end. First, I'm going to talk about the parts that I think Sanderson really excels at. He is probably the most thorough world builder I've come across. You can tell that he really, really cares about his work. He leaves no stone unturned. No I really mean it, you'll know about every stone in the vicinity of the characters. I've yet to read anything where the author spends as much time on world building as Sanderson. The one thing I did think was pretty cool was that he included some drawings of certain creatures in the book. I thought that was a really nice touch and really appreciated that. I sometimes have a hard time visualizing creatures that I'm not familiar with, so this was a huge bonus. Like I said, you can tell he really cares about his book. The magic system, while not perfect, was pretty neat. I have just as many things I liked about it as I had things that bugged me. But, that comes later. I really liked the shardblades! They were one of the more interesting aspects in this book, to me. The idea that they are summoned due to a few different factors was really unique. Once again, you can really tell Sanderson cares about this part of his book/world, as well. It feels like he put just as much care and pride into his magic system as he did with his world building. If nothing else, I really respect Sanderson for how much work he has put in here.Now, the fun part. The parts that ruined the book for me. The things I thought he excels in were also the things that ruined the book for me. My God, how much time needs to be spent describing the world? It ended up feeling like indulgence way too often. You think GRRM is bad at spending time describing pointless things? This is far worse. I really appreciate what he's done here, but come on, get to the interesting parts already. This, of course, is completely personal preference. But I much prefer when authors are able to use as little words describing the world as possible, while indirectly describing the world through more creative ways. Oh man, the magic system. While really cool, kind of annoying. The spren were a pretty cool way of getting some details across, but again, felt like too much at points. I felt like it broke immersion more than a few times to stop the little momentum we'd gain by going into a ""fear spren started gathering around his body"" or whatever. Yeah, I know he's scared, I don't need you to point it out to me. Which leads me to my next point. I feel like he thinks his readers aren't very intelligent. He would imply that someone is scared, then use spren to let you know he's scared just in case you didn't pick up on it. Or, something important would happen and we would get some cringy dialogue where he lets you know that something of importance is happening. *Sigh*, the dialogue. Oh so cringy at multiple points. Shallan is supposed to be this witty, silver tongued character, yet her dialogue was the exact opposite. While Kaladin would be one of my favorite characters, he too had some pretty bad dialogue. There wasn't many times where I was excited to hear conversations taking place. The characters, which are an integral part in whether I'll like a book or not, fell flat for me. The most interesting character, to me, was the spren following Kaladin around. Other than that, I had a hard time caring about the fate of any of the characters. The plot pacing was waaaaaaay too slow for me. I don't need action for even half of the book, but make something interesting happen. ANYTHING. I'm no stranger to slogging through a book to get to the juicy parts, but when you have to slog through 900 pages of descriptions of things that adds nothing interesting to the story (ok, that's not completely fair, but that's how it felt) then I begin to lose interest very quickly. This can usually be salvaged by some good characters, but like I said above, I wasn't really interested in them much, either. I feel like this could have been a 600 page novel and we could've gotten the same end results. I'm not a stranger to long novels where almost nothing happens until the end. One of my favorite series is Malazan Book of the Fallen, and that series has some very long books where the action doesn't take place til the last 20-25ish%. But that series made me feel something for the plot, the characters and the world. This made me feel nothing for any of it. Again, I'm not saying this is a bad book, I mean, just look at the overall rating. I just failed to connect with anything Sanderson tried to do. While this is mainly a fault of my own, and completely personal taste, I do think there were things that could've been done way better here. Even though I personally didn't like this book, I will still be recommending it for fans of epic fantasy."

Buddy Read April 2015 The Way of the Kings Group Thread
Buddy Read with Armina, Robin, Gavin, DesinkaApril 2014STORMFATHER! This book was amazing. This review may be spoilerish?!It has been a few years since I have read a high fantasy/epic fantasy such as this one. I just recently finished The Name of the Wind and that one is high fantasy, but it does not compare to The Way of Kings.I love books that are about war, swords and fighting just do something for me. I love books that go into detail of war, and strategy and the ins and out of how a war is fought. I sometimes even like the politics, in some books it's over done and some it's done just right. For me, it was done just right in this one. When I felt like it might be too much, the scene changed. The world building was amazing, the descriptions and the fashions of the different lands was awesome. I like to falling into a book that can take me away from every day life. I need a book to do that for me. I mean I even need a book to change my damn vocabulary. Now when I'm mad, I say ""Storm it"", or surprised ""Stormfather!"", or mad ""Damnation!"" Yeah, I think my family and co-workers think I am psycho. I need to want more, to fall in love with strong characters and want to give up my life so I can train in the art of sword fighting. I want two horses, one white and one black, just so I can name them Gallant & Sureblood. I want a ginourmous sword that I can name Oathbringer. If you haven't guessed yet, I love this book. I love it so much, I devoted a whole month to it and only was able to squeeze in three other books. THREE!! I normally read 15-20 books a month! And guess what, I am starting book two in three days! So I need to catch up on other reads before that starts. 119 Status Updates! 119! I think that's the most I have ever left for a book. My kindle app has already crashed from trying to upload all the highlights, notes, and marks I left. I think I might have highlighted half of the book...or more..""The love of men is a frigid thing, a mountain stream only three steps from the ice. We are his. Oh Stormfather...we are his. It is but a thousand days, and the Everstorm comes.""Dalinar Kholin, oh Dalinar you sexy man you. Of all the characters he is my favorite. Dalinar Kholin is an Alethi Highprince, he is fighting a war to avenge the death of his brother, the King, Gavilar. He is called the Blackthorn, and is a Shardbearer. To become a Shardbearer one has to win it in battle. You have to kill another Shardbearer and take their Shardplate and Shardblade. His only downfall, he has visions, hallucinations that can bring down him and his house. Dalinar believe in a united Alethkar and fights to bring it together and impose the code on his soldiers. Alethi Codes of WarReadiness-The Officer will be prepared at all times for battle. Never drunken on wine never without his weapon.Inspiration-The Officer will wear his uniform when in public to look ready for war and to give strength to his troops.Restraint-The Officer will refrain from needless duels, arguments, or squabbles with other officers in camp, to prevent injury to men who may be needed to command.Leadership-The Officer will require no action of his soldiers that he would not be willing to perform himself.Honor-The Officer will not abandon allies on the field, nor will he seek to profit from the loss of his allies. Before Gavilar dies, he leaves a message for Dalinar.You must find the most important words a man can sayTHE THRILL!Dalinar took a deep breath, feeling the Thrill build for the approaching battle. He strode from the war room, footfalls firm and solid. Attendants and servants scattered before him, making way. Wearing Shardplate again after a long period without was like waking up after a night of feeling groggy or disoriented. The spring of the step, the impetus the armor seemed to lend him, made him want to race down the hallway.He broke into a sprint. Teleb and the others cried out in surprise, rushing to keep up. Dalinar outpaced them easily, reaching the front gates of the complex and leaping through, throwing himself off the long steps leading down from his enclave. He exulted, grinning as he hung in the air, then slammed to the ground. The force cracked the stone beneath him, and he crouched into the impact.^^Favorite scene.Kaladin is the most honorable of heroes I have read. I thought Kvothe was amazing, but Kaladin takes the cake. He is a surgeons son, and now a slave. He fought in Amarams army and was eventually betrayed. He's lost his brother, his family and many many people along the way. He's an accomplished spearman, and a natural leader. He is sold to Sadeas as a bridgeman and is now apart of bridge four. From the beginning he is determined to keep his team alive, and he does everything he can to win his team over. Gadol spit up blood, coughing. ""They break the land itself!"" he hissed, eyes wild. ""They want it, but in their rage they will destroy it. Like jealous man burns his rich things rather than let them be taken by his enemies! They come!""He gasped. And then he fell still, his dead eyes staring upward, bloody spittle running in a trail down his cheek. His final, haunting words hung over them. Also I can not mention Syl, she's so funny and cute. I hope for a love match or something between her and Kaladin.
""Soon you'll hardly be a spren at all. You'll be a little translucent philosopher. We'll have to send you off to a monastery to spend your time in deep, important thoughts.""""Yes,"" she said, ""like how to best get the ardents there to accidentally drink a mixture that will turn his mouth blue.""She smiled mischievously.
Then there is Shallan. She is from Jah Keved and she is in Kharbranth seeking out the heretic Jasnah Kholin. She wishes to be become her ward and steal her precious soulcaster. I don't want to go into anymore without giving away what happens, but there are a lot of things we learn about Shallan and still a lot of things we do not know. ""Father,"" Adolin said, feeling pained, ""if there's something wrong here, it's that we're not trying hard enough. You think the highprinces are playing games? Well, show them the way it should be done! Instead of talking of retreat, we should be talking of advancing, striking at the Parshendi instead of besieging them.""Adolin Kholin, I was expecting to dislike him through out the entire book, but that changed the more I got to know him. Adolin loves to court women, loves to duel and has fierce loyalty to his father and family. He's very much Dalinar's son but unsure of things and unsure of himself. I guess any 23 year old would be. But he does worry about his father and his visions and if his father is really loosing his mind. I think the redeeming part for me is when he is actually fighting by his fathers side and confesses to believe all that his father has told him. The last 20% just threw me all over the place. I was sad, happy, angry, in shock, dumbfounded. I wanted to throw the phone/kindle/book across the room. I screamed! I yelled! And then I was determined to read the next damn book to find out what the hell is going on! There are no words to describe the last 20% and I see this review is probably the longest I have written. But know this, I will probably have 200 update statuses for the next book and have an even bigger book hangover having to wait MONTHS for the next. I can say that I am a new Brandon Sanderson addict. I need more..I want more...I will die if I don't get more!So if you love high fantasy, want to loose a month out of your life...please read this. Better yet, get the audio. So you can loose time while you washing clothes, walking to the car, driving to work, cleaning your house, working out at the gym, and while waiting for the doctor. Do it!P.S. There are way to many quotes and descriptions to put here but I will leave you with some of my favorites.MEN RIDE THE STORMS NO LONGER.

The Way of Kings,4,"As a huge fan of the fantasy genre, Brandon Sanderson was a name that I was continuously being turned to. I'd been recommended his books a number of times, I had just never gotten around to reading them. Every time I went to the bookstore and browsed the shelves, this book in particular taunted me from the shelf it sat on. The sheer size and girth of the book is impressive. I could use it as a doorstop, if I ever needed one, or ever actually treated a book that way. Being a college student, and employed full time makes taking on the task of reading such a massive book a bit overwhelming, so I kept putting it off until I couldn't stand it any longer and just had to read it. The Way of Kings is the first book in what will someday be a ten-book long series of epic fantasy proportions, entitled The Stormlight Archive. This first book is told from the shifting perspectives of the four main characters: First, you have Kaladin Stormblessed, a physicians apprentice and former soldier turned slave. Next you have Dalinar Kholin and his son Adolin, who command an army battling on the Shattered Plains for prestige, wealthy and the glory of their Kingdom while Dalinar tries to make sense of strange visions that begin to plague him. Lastly, there's Shallan, who has entered into an apprenticeship with a known heretic in the hopes of saving her family name from absolute ruin. Together, these characters begin to spin together a tapestry of interconnecting stories that will allegedly span the length of the series. From a World-Building standpoint alone, this book is an absolutely incredible feat. The world of Roshar that Sanderson has created feels real. Many fantasy books give you a map of a continent in the starting pages of the book, and end up telling a story that occurs on an Earth-like planet in appearance and feeling. With the land of Roshar, where this story takes place, Sanderson has gone to great lengths to create a world that looks and feels unique. It's not derivative of other fantasy series (that I could tell) and various races and cultures of people, plant and animal that he has created to fill the pages of this book astounded me. I can see how some people might be overwhelmed by it. At first, it feels a bit like being dropped feet first into the deep-end of a pool when you don't know how to swim, but as the story begins to come together and you find yourself beginning to really understand this world and how it works, the world itself became incredibly satisfying. Another area that Sanderson excels in, which I knew he would from reading some of his blog posts on his website, is in creating a magic system which has set rules, and costs for the characters using them. There's nothing worse than reading fantasy where a character is a magical being that ends up being unstoppable simply because the author forgot to write in any limits to, or ramifications for magic use. That is not the case here. Sanderson designed a magic system that is introduced within the opening pages of the book, and done so in a way that the reader immediately understands the cost of the magic, as well as the abilities inherent within it. Of course, that same magic system is further expanded on throughout the book, and it appears it will continue to expand in future novels, but the revelations made never felt like they went against what we knew so far about the system. This is one series that I feel should not be entered lightly, simply because of the scope and breadth of the story. It's very clear that this is not a story intended to be told in one book, but one that will see the characters face smaller plights that slowly draw them together over time and through a number of books. For example, this book has no true antagonist until the final few hundred pages. Before that point, the threat is shrouded in mystery and intrigue. The reader knows that something bad is coming, certainly, but we have no idea what it is for a large chunk of the book until it smacks the reader in the face. The final chunk of pages in the book did a great job of generating my continued interest in seeing what will happen next. There are two areas that I have to take a tiny bit of fault in with this book. The first, is in the armor that Sanderson created for Dalinar, Adolin, and a few other characters in the story. They have won through battle and now equip what they refer to as ""Shardplate,"" which is essentially plate armor and a similar Shardblade in it's superhero form. While wearing this armor, the characters become somewhat invincible, which I think sucked some of the suspense out of the action at times. Sure, they could become overwhelmed by the sheer number of enemy forces they faced, but at times it felt like watching Lord Sauron from the Lord of the Rings cutting down enemies in the opening scene to The Fellowship of the Ring. I worry that the armor makes characters a bit too safe. Secondly, I felt that some of the dialogue was a bit contrived. It's not the entire book, and it didn't happen often enough that I felt like my enjoyment was ruined, but the characters sometimes spoke with such a conventionally ""fantasy"" and proper manner of speech that it became somewhat grating. Shallan, for instance, is meant to be a very proper and somewhat sassy woman, but her quips that were meant to prove her intellect never really hit home for me. Similarly, Kaladin had a tendency to become incredibly repetitive in both his inner monologue and spoken dialogue which was annoying in it's own way, although I have high hopes that this will be quite different in future novels. All in all, this is definitely one of the strongest fantasy novels I've read in quite some time, and I am very much looking forward to starting the second book in the series in a few weeks. 4 out of 5 stars"
The Way of Kings,1,"If you have to read The Way of Kings - which you shouldn't do, but if you have to because your dad gave it to you and he's your dad - I recommend you do so while a little bit drunk. It makes this book a lot more fun. For example, when passages like this occur: She stared eastward, her expression horrified, eyes wide and sorrowful. It was the face of a child watching a brutal murder that stole her innocence. . . . well, I'd much rather read that sort of thing while slightly drunk.Now, I know it looks like I'm pushing you toward cirrhosis, given the length of the book and the fact that howlers of this kind pop up frequently. But hey: I'm not suggesting a drinking game (although it would be ridiculously easy to construct one) and actually, although The Way of Kings is quite terrible, it is never difficult to read. Part of that is because Sanderson repeats every piece of information at least three times and rehashes characterization infinitely, so you're unlikely to lose track of where you are because things have gone too quickly or subtly. It's like the whole thing was written as an audiobook, or something, with the assumption that no one would pause it during bathroom breaks. So it goes quickly - I probably could have read it in a day or two if I'd cared enough about what happened to put aside a weekend for the book.Relatedly, The Way of Kings isn't entirely unsalvageable, either. Part of the reason it's so bad (perhaps even the primary reason) is because Sanderson doesn't seem to know what is important. The world building seems to get a lot of praise in review, but reading the book, it seems more like he'd rather be a video or computer game writer or designer than a novel writer: there's a distinct WOW feel to this book, and the world has a lot of gimmicks, and the plot has really no forward momentum - it's like everyone is bouncing around until they reach the next level. (I'm just saying: when you find yourself writing about ""anticipationspren"" that is a Red Flag.) So, if he'd cut out the prelude and the prologue, which are mostly establishing the setting - and it's not, frankly, such an opaque setting that a reasonably intelligent person couldn't figure it out as they went along (and anyway, there is something to be said for not telling your readers more than you tell your characters) - the book already has a more compelling opening. Cut even more - follow the Mamet rule and get rid of the first 20 minutes/150 pages - so that we start with Kaladin being glum in a slave cart and we're great. But even more egregious than the info-dumping (stuff I don't need to know: currency rates in anything but the broadest outline, what tertiary characters are wearing, and so on) are the endless flashbacks. I wish we could eliminate flashbacks from literature, I really do. But even if we can't do that, I wish we could limit Brandon Sanderson to a couple - again, this isn't so opaque or intricate a book that I can't pick up clues about formative experiences when they are referenced twenty times a chapter, okay? BUT ALSO: that stuff doesn't matter. It really, really doesn't. The book would be both better and shorter without those flashbacks. Like, of course it's going to be ten books: fully half of each book is going to be extraneous to the plot.The other big problem, as you might have guessed, is that Sanderson thinks his readers are very stupid. For example, if something important has just happened, and most of the book has been devoted to its occurrence, I don't need: ""Something just changed,"" Moash whispered, hand up. ""Something important."" Yeah, we'd already got there! It's terrible writing anyway, just from an aesthetic perspective. Likewise, I don't need every bit of characterization spelled out for me. For one, a bit of ambiguity is valuable - otherwise it looks like a casting call or stage directions. For another, character is expressed by dialogue and action and if a writer is a good hand in at least one of those, then passages like Navani was always at her most genuine when playing with new fabrials. It was one of the few times when one got to see her without any pretense. This wasn't Navani the king's mother or Navani the political schemer. This was Navani the excited engineer. are entirely unnecessary.Good things about this book: The food sounds delicious. The male/female divide is kind of interesting. Kiiiiind of. It passes the Bechdel test!Other bad things: The battle and fight scenes were super boring and awkwardly written, and there are a loooooooot of them."
The Way of Kings,2,"This is a thousand page tome that is supposedly the first in a ten book series...which presupposes that I'm looking forward to at least 10,000 pages of the story. I'm sorry the story just isn't that good.I note that most of the ratings on this book are 4s and 5s...and 1s. There seems to be little middle ground. So, I'll go to the middle a bit. I neither hate nor love this book and I'll say now I have no intention of following the series...Of course it could be that I'll be hard pressed to live to see it's end, though being human I hope that isn't the case (LOL). The story failed to draw me in opening with historical hints and cryptic facts hidden in the accounts. From there it skips from point of view to point of view. A prisoner learning to put up with a ""spirit"" fairy like ""companion"" or a young woman wishing to become what amounts to a royal ward...so on and so on, and off we go. With nine more vast tomes to go in what is apparently to be Mr. Sanderson's magnum opus (depending I suppose on how long it takes to finish) I just don't find this story that enthralling.I am putting the series away. While it has some good writing (I'm always conscious of the fact that I'm unpublished and anyone could justly say...""and where's your best seller?"") the writing isn't consistent and the story strikes me as (so far) a bit patchy. So, while this is a somewhat enjoyable book, and I congratulate Mr. Sanderson on it, I have a limited amount of both money and TIME, and a LOT of books I'm truly anxious to read. So, I step away from this series, I simply don't find it that enthralling. "
The Way of Kings,4,"Four stars, maybe it's three. Not that it's bad. I listened to the book. It’s a lot of information to absorb. My son didn’t have any problem, and he fields all my questions. The first installment of a trilogy, it is 45 hours and 37 minutes long as audio or 1008 pages text. The world building is excellent. There are a lot of characters, but none of them get short shrift. The portrayal of a functional, but depressed young man is extremely good. For most of the book, Kaladin sounds like an old man; It’s easy to forget that he is barely out of teens. I wondered if the color-coded peoples stirred any objection. It led me to an instructive commentary on Mythcreants.com, Five Signs Your Story Is Racist. Sanderson fans promptly pointed out that all references to Sanderson’s work were in fact based on fan art, not the books. I didn’t know that Klingons ever appeared in TOS without wearing blackface.https://mythcreants.com/blog/five-sig..."
The Way of Kings,4,"Life before deathStrength before weaknessJourney before destination The Knights RadiantThe Way of Kings is an enormous book with many main characters along with their unique story to tell. Brandon Sanderson has created an epic account of the lives of these people and their struggles to survive and persevere with multiple sacrifices made. Although a tad too long with excessive battles, The Way of Kings is full of rich and colourful individuals; it is assuredly a gratifying thrilling tale! Prepare to be held spellbound and thoroughly entertained by this fascinating book."
The Way of Kings,4,"4-4.5*The purpose of a storyteller is not to tell you how to think, but to give you questions to think upon.And boy does Sando ever!He has created yet another vivid world. The length of this book and indeed series has given him such scope to create whole new ecosystems, creatures & people unlike any I've seen in his previous works. Admittedly, I am by no means an expert!🙊The rich and colourful descriptions really paint such a brilliant image of this world and the odd pieces of art scattered throughout really help my limited imagination picture the many unique animals and plant life - yep, even the greenery is somewhat active in this one 😂Soooo many names! 🤯To say this opening book has a large cast of characters puts GRRM to shame, everyone remotely mentioned has a name even if we only see them once! There are so many people from such a variety of backgrounds and different ranks within these backgrounds each with their own distinguishing features that sets them apart from light or dark eyes, to crazy long eyebrows (yes they tuck them behind their ears 😱) through hair colour, skin colour even down to different nail colours (not painted!) and those that can apparently self-tattoo through thought for reminders!It is a lot to try to keep track of and I cannot pretend that I remember or can distinguish them all despite the many notes I have attempted to take on my phone 😅As for the magic system 🤔It seems so layered and there are many different threads to it. From Shard-armour through Fabrials, Stormlight & Spren yet I feel we are only seeing the very tip of the iceberg. I cannot wait to see how Sando fleshes it all out for us!This book is shared with the help of many strands of different stories told from multiple PoV. Although I think it would be fair to say this is (mainly) Kaladin's book as he's the only character to get flashback chapters...I think there may have been one or two moments for other characters but Kaladin deffo has the monopoly on flashbacks.There are the main players in the current timeline popping up in different countries/kingdoms of this world. Then there are different characters PoVs that show up in the interludes. 3 each time with 2 of those being from new places depicting snapshots of people from other cultures that are briefly mentioned in the main storyline & the 3rd PoV in the interludes is a very interesting character who we first meet at the very beginning. So it was great to have them pop up from time to time & I gotta admit that I gathered most of my intel about how some of this magic system works from this PoV.The characters without going into any spoiler'y details and while we are deffo only scratching the surface on them despite the length of this book...I feel like they have the scope for such growth & representation. I cannot speak to what we often look for when it comes to rep these days with regard to orientation/gender/ethnicity as being fantasy the ethnicities are all made up in this world and to date there has been no suggestion as to orientation preferences outside m/f but I've no idea whether this may change as the series continues 🤞However the barebones being laid out for mental health rep is fascinating to me. Not least for the journey some of these characters have already undertaken in this first book! Sando has created complicated characters with already ingrained issues and those who will no doubt have different troubles and repercussions to deal with going forward in the series based off their behaviour and actions in this opening book. He has not shied away from self-reflection and introspective analysis by the characters of themselves, including darker turns for some of them at points.As I said - much scope for interesting character growth and this is before we take into account how the cast will undoubtedly grow further as the series expands!There are snippets at the start of most chapters which are intriguing. I am very curious to see what comes of them! I may or may not have taken pictures of them all & am thinking I might have to write them down elsewhere so as not to block all my phone memory before I start Book2!Now, in saying all the above...as always apologies for the length of this ""review"" - let's be honest tho, it's more a collection of verbal vomited musings haphazardly cobbled together.Anyways if you've made it this far you're probably wondering why my rating is lower than the length of this ""review"" & the amount of reader updates I've shared might lead one to anticipate.This is not a reflection on the quality of writing or character/world building, but more so a consequence of this being the first book for such a massive series & that itself is no shrimp clocking in at 1000+ pages!For something so darn big, not a lot has happened so far! We have met different characters, some plot points have been hinted at and breadcrumbs have been scattered about but I think that in order to really appreciate what has been done in this first book I need to reread when I have a clearer understanding and can really appreciate what has been done here...I am sure that when that day comes the rating for this book will only increase.I completely understand why this is so detailed and on the one hand love the deep dive into the world this offers us - but at the same time it can be heavy going when we just cannot see the bigger picture yet. It's a bit of an unfortunate double edged sword type situation for me.However I have the utmost faith in BrandoSando and am very much looking forward to reading on and discovering everything he is willing to share about the Cosmere 😇Hopefully there'll be no pitchforks & torches coming for me after this 🤗"
The Way of Kings,4,"Full Video Review Here: https://youtu.be/DAma-wpXDJ4Video Spoiler Thoughts Here: https://youtu.be/gh3iouz0igMWhat can I say about The Way of Kings that you haven't already read in the (as of fall 2020) 20k reviews already on Goodreads? How about what makes this series unique.I think what really attracted me to The Stormlight Archive was that while it seems traditional epic fantasy, it was different enough that I couldn't stop reading. And that began with Sanderson's best character work to date. While I loved the crew from Mistborn, I never really felt like they were real people with everyday people problems. With The Way of Kings, we get a trio of main characters that feel extremely real.Kaladin, Dhalinar, and Shallan aren't your usual traditional fantasy heroes in that none of them actually are. The word ""damaged"" is the best way I can use to describe each of them. Kaladin suffers from extreme depression, Shallan copes with the strain of getting her family out of trouble through living a lie, and Dhalinar is filled with great remorse from his tyrannical past.Writing normal, everyday people problems into his characters made me identify and care about them much faster than I usually would in a world this big. And let's talk about that world; it feels extremely lived in with a real history and lore behind it. Most fantasy fare talks about that big even from 15 to 20 years ago, but this one talks about events that span thousands of years and feel like more than just info dumps.The magic is up to the usual standards of the Sanderson investiture, even if it might not be quite as complex as allomancy, but there is certainly a learning curve involved, as there is with the rest of the book. A world so epic in scope it's hard to find a comparison, spectacular character arcs that feel earned and incredibly satisfying, and plenty of unanswered questions to make the 1001 pages on hardcover simply fly by while you're running to pick up book #2. Storms, what a start."
The Way of Kings,3,"Well, I did it. I began this book with a lot of trepidation on the one hand — I really disliked The Eye of the World, and I knew Brandon Sanderson had taken over the writing of the last couple Wheel of Time novels, so I feared I would run into similar issues here — and a lot of hope on the other — several of my Goodreads bookworm friends, whose taste often overlaps with mine, really loved it. And in the end, I wound up feeling squarely conflicted about it. Much to my relief, I’m pleased to report that it was a many-times-better read than The Eye of the World in pretty much every way. Like by a magnitude of a LOT. The world Sanderson created is vivid and mysterious and fully realized, and it’s peopled by characters who are, for the most part, richly drawn. But the prose itself was often so very irritating to behold that it kept pulling me out of the story and the moment-to-moment beats of that story. I am shocked that some of his lazy habits — repetitive, shallow descriptions in scenes of characters sighing, raising an eyebrow, shrugging, smiling, and snorting; as well as mundane, paint-by-numbers descriptions of what almost every character is wearing — made it through the editing process. And almost without fail, when I found myself really grooving with a scene, (although, sadly, never with any real emotional investment), Sanderson seemed unable to resist shining ten spotlights on the themes and meaning of what he was writing about in the scene. He is almost totally allergic to allowing any real, lasting subtlety to linger in his writing.Part of the reason this last tendency became so irritating to me is that I think the themes he is working with — themes of honor and resilience and family and survival and the costs of war, among others — are very worthy, and I think he has some compelling ideas he’s exploring within those themes. So my disappointment mounted as I kept crashing into his seeming inability to simply let his themes and characters and scenes speak for themselves. So yeah, I found myself often feeling like this book and I were in a fight. And it’s a damn long book, so being in a fight, especially since I knew it could be so much better with a more disciplined, subtle approach, was a bit of a draining experience. However, by no means do I feel like reading this book was a waste of my time, not even close. The 3 star rating here is really the embodiment of the middle ground I feel between my admiration for his very impressive achievement of proof of concept, and my utterly baffled frustration with much of his sentence-to-sentence execution in the writing of that concept. "
The Way of Kings,1,"The Way of Kings was recommended to me by several people independently of one another. One of them even went so far to say it was the best book they've ever read.It is not a good book. It's 1001 pages of Brandon Sanderson presenting his cartoon world of Roshar in juvenile, trashy prose like:
He looked eastward, over the Shattered Plains. His home. His sepulcher. This life on them was ripping him apart. The bridgemen looked up to him, their leader, their saviour. But he had cracks in him, like the cracks in the stone here at the edges of the Plains.
There is a strong theme of religion, duty, and sacrifice throughout. What I call ""the metaphysics of the Shattered Plains"" is the theme that life is hell, and our purpose in life is really to ease the suffering of our fellow man before their inevitable and tragic end at the hands of a power beyond our control and comprehension. About half way into the book I started thinking ""Brandon Sanderson must be religious"". A hundred pages more got me thinking ""he's not only religious, he's Mormon, just like Orson Scott Card."" And yes, that turns out to be the case.Then a bit later, I thought ""Brandon Sanderson is eight years old."" The story is filled with childish categories of things. Like different ""colors of wine"", and the different gemstones serving different functions, and the fact that people with light eyes and black hair are somehow the rulers of the world, and the ones with dark eyes (and, to a greater extent, dark skin) are their servants. And the names of things, and all the internal jargon. There are entire paragraphs whose every other word is just jargon:
Oh, Stormfather, Adolin thought, stomach twisting in pain. Jezerezeh, Kelek, and Ishi, Heralds above. Let me find a way to right this. Please. ""I will return to Alethkar,"" Dalinar said. ""Though I hate to leave our army here down a Shardbearer.""
I just can't take this seriously.And the spren. Oh my god, the spren. Apparently this world is full of spirit creatures called ""spren"", different species of which show up to feed on different spiritual experiences. There are ""anticipationspren"" and ""gloryspren"". Every time some kind of spren was mentioned in the text, eyerollspren rose from the ground around me, for real. It is an infuriatingly terrible device that serves no apparent purpose and frequently invites contradictions in the story.On the positive side, there are some interesting ideas in here about taboo and gender roles. Also on the positive side, I can now safely remove all works by Brandon Sanderson from my reading list, and I can guiltlessly ignore all future recommendations by people who say they've enjoyed this uninspiring, needlessly verbose, self-indulgent garbage."
The Way of Kings,1,"I'm giving up on this one. And I'm seriously befuddled. The reviews for this book were so uniformly wonderful and full of good things. ""Great World-Building""; ""Well-thought out magic systems""... All the stuff I look for in Fantasy. So I was really surprised when this turned into everything I hate about Fantasy novels. 1. Full-on HoodooMy best experiences with Fantasy novels have always begun from a relatable place. A world mostly like ours and characters with recognizable emotions, desires and problems make the rest of the author's universe palatable. But when your first introduction is to The Weird it doesn't compel me to read further. 2. Long action sequences up frontI feel like I fell into Boris Vallejo's nightmare. 3. Ganky names""fearspren""; ""Voidbringers""--this is bad, adolescent writing. 4. Goo?!?Every emotion seems to have a corresponding fairy-type creature associated with it, called ""---spren"". (ie. fearspren). In the opening pages one of these is described as ""globs of purple goo"". Really. Clunky, weak and inartful. I'm just not impressed. A few reviewers say that you have to keep reading and that it picks up about 800 pages in. No offense, but I can read 3 good books with an 800 page investment. I don't care to put that kind of time into a book that has me so frustrated at 200 pages. "
The Way of Kings,1,"I feel like I really need to get to writing this review, but I was so let down by this work that I just don't know how to go about writing it. Course... I could always go the way of a list! It's a terrible way to review, but it'll work for now. Probably forever as I don't see myself spending too much time with it.1. If you've read other works by Sanderson you'll recognize the character types. They're what he's grown accustomed to and uses for every book. Usually there's something to set them apart from the characters of other books, but this time it didn't happen. 2. The point of view changes were poorly placed. I'm not really much of a fan of having a set rotation for each character, but this... this was just too sporadic. 3. Palindromes. Palindromes are not cool. I know a lot of people seem to think words that mirror themselves are interesting, but they aren't. Sadly Sanderson is a fan of them so there are a ton of the things in this book. It's explained away as being tied into a religion, but it doesn't make them any less annoying. 4. World building isn't great. Throughout the entire novel I was left wondering about the world - not just the workings of society, but the terrain and how it all tied together. I'm left thinking of this world as a rocky wasteland, but I'm not sure that's right. 5. There are intermission chapters that come in sets of three throughout the book. They serve no purpose though. They introduce us to characters that will probably be in the story later, but being introduced now seems like such a waste and just a means to increase the pages of the first book. I certainly won't remember these random characters in a year or however long it is until we see them again. A few pages on them just isn't going to leave a lasting impression. They really should have been introduced when they served a purpose to the story. The chapters with Sveth were somewhat relevant and became more so towards the end, but even those felt out of place.6. The dialog is pretty terrible. Well learned characters or characters with a sharp mind come across as nothing like that. There's the character Shallan who is supposed to have a sharp tongue, but her words are akin to a mdidle schoolers. She really has no good argument or comebacks. Then there's Wit... a character who is supposed to be witty. Wonderful play on his name, huh? He's not witty. He's an elementary school kid. He does nothing in the book to earn him the title of Wit. He calls people slow or says they wear silly clothing and that's his wit. 7. Sanderson just rambles on and on and on for no reason. He spends so much time writing about absolutely nothing. He tried to build up to stuff in the story, but failed miserably. By the time he ever got to a ""big reveal"" you already knew what it was and at that point you, frankly, just didn't give a damn. The book was never really interesting until the last 100 pages. Events happened there that were predictable, but it was entertaining still. "
The Way of Kings,2,"May 2019 - i'm lowering my score. I've no intention of reading book 2 and on reflection it was fairly average------""Kalak rounded a rocky stone ridge and stumbled to a stop before the body of a dying thunderclast...""I bought the Way of Kings in December 2017 and had every intention of reading it immediately but i started the Malazan series instead and was reluctant to begin another fantasy saga. Plus Malazan was finished and Stormlight had only three releases out of a forecasted ten. After the farce with Winds of Winter and KingKiller i wanted to read at least one completed series.I’m glad i waited because reading Malazan first has made me appreciate Way of Kings more. With a decent fantasy book you have to be prepared to wait and have rock solid patience. Book 1 of the Stormlight Archive is 1124 pages and i’d say 80% is laying the foundations for the epic story Brandson Sanderson is preparing us for. We are slowly introduced to the world of Roshar, it’s inhabitants and the way things work. At times it was slow going but interesting and well written enough to compel me to read on.The story focuses on three characters; Ex-soldier and newly branded slave Kaladin is sent to the Shattered Plains to act as a Bridgeman in the avenging Kings army; Dalinar, a veteran in said Kings army, is having frightening visions that may or may not be from the past when the Knights Radiant ruled the world and finally Shallan, pursuing a wardship with Dalinars Niece Jasnah, is attempting to steal Jasnahs soulcasting stone but finds herself drawn into the mystery of the Voidbringers.I personally enjoyed Shallans story over the other two and would of liked more from her but i guess the intention was to leave you wanting as Words of Radiance is supposed to focus on her. Kaladin is your standard fantasy hero who is the least intriguing and Dalinars visions are brilliant and make up some of the strongest parts of the story.As well as the main story there are three sets of short interlude chapters, that mainly follow the intriguing character of Szeth who isn’t overused and is obviously being saved for later books.For the opener of a fantasy series The Way of Kings is slow going but well worth the pay off, especially the last couple of chapters leaving the story nicely poised for book 2."
The Way of Kings,1,"Although many readers love and admire Brandon Sanderson's works I have to say after The Way of Kings that I'm not one of those people. It's hard for me to put my finger on what I don't exactly enjoy, but I know I find his writing boring and difficult to connect to overall."
The Way of Kings,1,"“The Way of Kings” is tedium defined.What novel is everyone else reading? My objections to this tome are almost its equal in length. I wish to be fair, and mete out credit where due and marshal criticism only when I think it justified. There are really 4 main characters in this novel of 1000+ pages, one of whom has myriad lengthy, unnecessary flashbacks (not little flashes, mind you – dozens of chapters). The world is at war with a nebulous enemy, lots of weird generic-sounding prophecy is bandied about, and everyone is a Mary Sue. To be very direct, my opinion is as follows:Good stuff: 1. The storms. Although this borrows from ASOIAF, having a world besets by extreme meterological conditions is plausible and relatively fresh. It seizes on the unpredictability of medieval conflicts, and how they may be decided by factors beyond human control (e.g. the Battle of Hastings).2. Action. I don’t need much of this to be satisfied with sci-fi or fantasy. In fairness, “The Way of Kings” has far too little physical combat when compared to its ridiculous dialogue and long expositions. But often BS does a nice, clean job with the combat and the magic system (certain swords take time to be conjured when starting a battle or when dropped, for example).3. Gender roles. Only women are literate in this world. It’s an interesting dynamic with lots of possibilities for narrative subtlety, deception, or mechanisms for keeping the societies coherent. Ultimately, this falls through because nothing interesting ever happens vis-à-vis this huge difference in education between men and women. Men fight and run armies, women manage lands and letters and books and so on. That is the literal and dull extent to which BS takes it.These strengths I do admit. Alas, they were superseded by the mediocre, tired, and unremarkable, as I will now argue.Show>TellWhenever a character or place is introduced, Sanderson proceeds to explain him/her/it to us directly, immediately. Soulless infodumps abound, nothing is ever shown to the reader. There is no personality and no flavor to any of the narrative. No land or culture means anything to me, except that the Parshendi are “bad” and “violent” and paint their faces. I’d say the entire novel is unadulterated narrative -- unthinking, unflinching, pleased with its details merely because the details exist. It is insufficient to have maps and character names and lengthy dramatis personae. If everyone is a milquetoast shadow of a human being, things get tedious fast. That tribe? They paint their faces. That one? They have such-and-such religion based on XYZ, explained immediately after some dialogue about their religion. It is all babble. Already forgotten.Every single character is impossibly daft and literal, and is a major noodge.A conversation with one of the cleverest heroes is presented below, and there are dozens of similar quality: [Conversation between a male merchant and Shallan, a female character, about buying used books. Shallan speaks first.]“Is ambition such an unseemly attribute in a young woman?”“Well, no, I suppose not.” He smiled again—the thick, toothy smile of a merchant trying to put someone at ease. “I can see you are a woman of discriminating taste.”“I am,” Shallan said, voice firm though her heart fluttered. Was she destined to get into an argument with everyone she met? “I do like my meals prepared very carefully, as my palate is quite delicate.”“Pardon. I meant that you have discriminating taste in books.”“I’ve never eaten one, actually.”Groan. Fucking groan. Nothing funny happens, ever.No one has wit, even a character named Wit who the narrator tells us incessantly is ... witty. Everyone has the same emotional sophistication: that of an obnoxious 6th grader.No cursing or any adult situations of any kind. Perhaps because of the author’s Mormonism (although ‘tis egregious regardless) there is no adult dialogue or adult situation to be found in the 1,007 pages herein. When people curse, they say “storm you!” which slaps me right out of the story. There is no sex or romance or even a hint of one adult interpersonal dynamic. This is a tribal medieval society with tensions over land and religion and power, albatrossed by a Sunday-school content filter. Why is this author so stultified when it comes to real adult fantasy? The Wheel of Time is practically pornographic next to Stormlight, which should be in the YA section. Of course fantasy doesn’t need to be dirty or violent to be good, but the absence of any naughtiness and the profusion of awkward workarounds, particularly for sexual tension, is conspicuous. There is mild violence and a touch of blood, again consistent with a predictably American pattern of cultural conservatism.When a middle-aged couple finally realized their mutual love after many years and began ""courting"" I shuddered at the Terran creepiness.Atrocious writing and shameful world buildingThis is not a new or particularly interesting world. Everything is on loan. Characters spend their lives studying the infantile philosophy of the world, which is hammered into the reader again and again. Sanderson has also famously said he tries for “Orwellian” prose. I think he thinks this means compound words:Sword moves: Windstance, Smokestance, Stonestance, etc.Magical nouns: Shardplate. Shardstone. Voidbringers. Oathpact. I repeat: oathpact. Magic happenings: incredibly literal and boring. When someone is mad, “angerspren” (small magic beings) spring out of the nearby rocks/trees/landscape/objects. When a character is afraid, “fearspren” sprout. Passionspren. And so on. Horrible.Creatures: Chasmfiend. I kid you not.Characters: one major character is a great swordsman, uncle of the young king, and is nicknamed “The Blackthorn”. More-than-merely-borrowed from ASOIAF. The cousin of awful: derivative.Chapter intros: Every chapter is preceded by an excerpt of historical text, syllogisms, or lore from within the Stormlight universe. Which would be cool if it was cohesive (it isn’t) or lead to a reveal (it doesn’t) or wasn’t part of the Elantris or Mistborn novels (as it was in all cases). Think about Frank Herbert’s Dune, where those excerpts were utilized to terrific effect, and a reader immediately sees BS’s chapter intros as perfunctory and pointless.Clichés: Downtrodden, ripped warrior slave is slow to accept his obvious Superpowers. No main character is ever in real danger. Everyone is hot and brilliant. The nefarious enemy race turns out to have a hive mind. Economics: This has been pointed out elsewhere. There exists the ability, not uncommon at that, to Soulcast/transform one material into another. Stone into gold, or food, or anything. This abnegates the material concerns and need for forced labor/feudal systems/farming that animate much of the conflict. Not thought out and rings false. Let’s be clear. The unimaginative isn’t a crime because it is merely boring. This giant novel is, after all, a poor but earnest attempt at world building. Rather, the problem is this: as soon as my eyes pass across “fearspren”, suddenly I’m in a café. When they see “Oathpact” I’m groaning in my bed watching the ceiling fan. Feats by the “Blackfishthorn” remind me I’m on the train and a little thirsty. Extreme, self-conscious, unedited prose plucks us from our fantasy world and deposits us unceremoniously back in our own. Nonsense like “The Way of Kings” is a disaster for epic fantasy, and reaffirms its reputation as a lowbrow genre. I am shocked that this is the minority opinion among readers of such a disastrous novel. And finally:The author has explicitly stated it shall be a 10-volume series.This is the kiss of death. No one could conceivably make such a preposterous estimate of length except to impress us with page count ab inisio (“so epic!”). Also, BS updates his readers on his writing progress on his website. We can objectively say that he has not outlined or planned ahead, and is therefore not justified in promising TEN novels. By committing to a 10-book series, he has made a cardinal sin of fantasy: Thou shalt not have epic length without epic content.It pains me to say this, because at times I felt that The Final Empire and Elantris were decent stories. I still do. I daresay that The Gathering Storm was one of the best entries in the Wheel of Time Series – my heart was rattling in my chest when Egwene was defending the White Tower. Here, I borrow from Mark Twain in calling this what it is: chloroform in print."
The Way of Kings,3,"🖤After reading this storming book, i've come to the conclusion that Sanderson might not be as brilliant as i thought he was. I picked this book up mid last year and promptly abandoned it after reading a couple of chapters. I just wasn't feeling, i actually thought it was me not being in the right head space for a book most people swear has to be the most epic of all epic fantasies ever written. However, after going through this frankly too long book, i have to say it's not me, it's Sanderson.🖤🖤A brilliant thing with Sanderson is his world building. The detailing with each cosmere is something this author doesn't joke with, so much so that for this book, he put this ahead of building his characters and the plot. You can see this default especially, but not limited to his female characters. Navani, Jasnah and especially Shallan. Sanderson picks one aspect of their character and makes it everything they're about. Shallan is the blusher, Navani is the sly one, Jasnah is stern. On and on he uses the exact same words to describe his female characters forcing readers to only see them in this way as if they cannot be more than that. Back to world building; People usually excuse 1st books as foundation books especially in the fantasy genre as authors usually have the heavy task of establishing how everything works basically building a world (it's no easy feat). Meaning authors tend to just go crazy with the info dump which is what Sanderson tries and does succeed in doing in this book. As a seasoned author i honestly feel he should be able to build worlds without sacrificing his plot to do so. Nothing got done really. Everyone just kept going round and round on the same issue, repeating everything but in different words, and being SUBJECTED (yes subjected) to pointless religious theology  (I don't even rember what all the argument was about, it was so tiring) and as if that wasn't enough, those heaps of confusing interludes. I have no doubt that they will probably be explained, (or is that just another way of making sure the series never end?? An abundance of never ending characters maybe? *scream*) but it felt distracting from the plot. For that reason, i really didn't immerse myself in any of the interludes except that of Szeth. Honestly, it was a bit bizarre the things Sanderson spent time giving page count to sometimes. I mean, Adolin's girlfriends' got a fair amount of word count, WHY?? i can't even remember their names. Then the romance. I really don't want to go into that except to say it just felt unnatural the way it was introduced. *shudder*🖤There was also the fact that i just felt some things were frankly ignored, which just didn't make sense to me & felt like huge plot holes. (view spoiler)[📍For instance later in the book we learn that Sadeas had switched places with Galivar in other to try to trick the assassin. When they ran off, are you telling me they weren't checking to see if the assassin was actually following them? Like you just run off and don't check that the assassin you're trying to draw off isn't following you? who does that? 📍How was nobody curious about Szeth sticking himself to the roof like that. Dude was sticking himself to the roof during the assassination attempt and nobody is curious about all that?📍When Kaladin mentions Odiom to Syl and she acts crazy, he just lets it go like that and they all act like nothing happens? Infact at their next interaction it's like the whole thing never happened. (hide spoiler)]🖤🖤While impressive in length, i'm not convinced this book is as epic as it's lauded to be and is quite frankly able to get away with being hailed as anything but mediocre and even less than that, because of it's author and maybe the world building.Verdict:"
The Way of Kings,3,"Wow. Brandon Sanderson is incredibly creative. The world he builds in The Way of Kings is phenomenal. This is the first book I've read by him and if it's any indication of his work, he has a fabulous talent for creating conflict in imaginary worlds. I love how he gradually weaves his characters and plots together in ways that raise interesting moral and philosophical issues but still move the story along in intricate and unexpected directions. In that way, The Way of Kings is excellent.My only qualm with the book is that Sanderson, like most other novelists I've read whose name is printed larger than the title of the book, doesn't shine as a stylist. There are too many long, and sometimes boring, flashbacks. Everything is shown explicitly. An example that stands out in my mind is that when someone is killed by shard, their eyes burn out. We're told this every time someone is killed by shard. Sanderson doesn't trust the reader to visualize what's happening. The same is true of the ""spren"" that appear every time someone is in pain or sick or excited or experiencing any strong emotion. It's not enough to show a character sitting on the ground panting in exhaustion, we have to see the fatigue fairies emerging just to drive home the point that yep, the character is really tired. Also, people aren't kind, they're ""kindly."" And in a fantasy world you can't really say what's an anachronism and what isn't, but there are many times where the language feels like it's from Earth, year 2010 then in the next sentence back to the old-style used throughout the rest of the book.Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the book. A lot. I devoured the 1000+ pages and looked forward to reading it at every opportunity. It just seemed like such a shame that what could have been an excellent book with some additional editing was instead just a good book.[Edited to tone down my whining.]"
The Way of Kings,2,"I finished this one. Some background before my comments. I listened to this as an audiobook over the last 3 or 4 months while walking...Previous to this I had decided Sanderson wasn't for me, as his stories are entertaining enough but very bland in their presentation. The only reason I picked this one was because it gave me many, many hours of walking. Also, I don't tend to love big, fat fantasy. So, my thoughts:First, the good. I really quite liked the world concept Sanderson has going here. There are interesting mysteries here and the cosmology and political structure seems very interesting from the little bit we see of it here. This aspect of the book really worked for me. Unfortunately.....So much of it was buried in overly wordy, dull, verbose, walls of unnecessary words talking about relatively dull main characters going about predictable revelations. Out of the 45-hour audio book, I called pretty much all of the actual plot by about hour 15. The here-and-now plotting of the story, the vehicle by which Sanderson conveyed all that stuff I said I liked in the previous paragraph, was some of the worst stuff I've made myself endure in a long while. Sanderson is so very workmanlike with his prose that it brings me to tears. There's just no texture to it, no joy to the reading of it, it doesn't engage me on any level other than just telling me what happened. And for a book this long, that's not a way to win points with me. I've read much shorter books over the last few months that say so much more than this did (either thematically or in actual interesting plot development). The three main characters are people we've seen countless times in fantasy somewhere or other. And as a genre that thrives on tropes, that's fine. But they're not interesting people we've seen countless times. They're pretty much exactly by the book in all respects, no surprises, no reactions that anyone who has read a few books couldn't predict outright after just a few chapters.I do have to commend Sanderson for trying to inject some philosophical ideas into the writing, but again...they feel like they're being presented either for or by lackwit Intro to Philosophy students. They're heavy-handed and cumbersome. So I'm torn on this series a bit. If Sanderson could tighten up his storytelling, add some atmosphere, some real feeling to his writing, some zest of some kind I'd be up for reading more of this series. If not, then not so much...which is a shame, as the things I like about it are things I REALLY like. But given his sales and popularity he's clearly aiming at a particular audience and hitting the mark dead on, so who am I to complain."
The Way of Kings,3,"3.5 ish stars.Hallelujah! I thought I would never finish this book. No lie, I sometimes felt like a herald being sent back to torture in damnation every time opened it. Not that the book is bad. Just long. I'm proud of myself for finishing. It's hard for me to rate this book (3 stars or 4?) because it's a tale of two books. A 5-star book that astonishes and elates and a 2-star book of which I couldn't read without dozing off. And there's no warning when one book will end and the other begin. Despite the monumental challenge it was to finish this, however, I want to continue with the series. I'll try to process my feelings here:Things I liked:Obviously the scope of the story is EPIC. And not simply because there are a ridiculous 1,500 pages that make it up, but because the worldbuilding, the magic systems, the themes, the history, everything is on such a grand scale. It's transportive and intoxicating. The exploration of the themes: the comparison of religion vs. truth vs. legend and how they intersect; what it means to be a leader, to have courage, to be honorable; moral relativism and how good and evil aren't cut and dry. Some heavy, if not frequently explored, themes but they're addressed thoroughly and satisfyingly.Things I didn't like:1500 BLOODY PAGES. The length of this book is absolutely unjustified. Partly because at least 600 pages worth is just repeated information and unnecessary exposition. I can name to you everyone that Kaladin has ever let down because HE REPEATS IT AT LEAST 891 TIMES. Pacing. The prologue made me think that this would be a pretty neat book. Assassination! Cool powers! Sweet weapons! The following 1000 pages tried so hard to prove that initial impression wrong. And I feel like most books will build to a climax at about 70% of the way through. Instead, here there are several mini-climaxes that are each drawn out long enough to bring the excitement to a screeching halt. The battle at the end involving Kaladin/Dalinar would have been so much more epic if it wasn't five times longer than necessary. I won't go quite as far as saying this was a love-hate relationship, because I can't bring myself to stay away from book 2. As negative as I seem to be, I really enjoyed most of it. Sanderson is a good author and his creativity is through the roof. What the man needs is a better editor. I volunteer as tribute."
The Way of Kings,3,"
“One step, and the world flipped upside down. The villain became the hero, the hero the villain.”
The Way of Kings was the July pick that Álex, Raquel and I chose for our 2020 Adult Fantasy & Sci-Fi Challenge. After reading Elantris, The Final Empire and The Well of Ascension, I knew I wanted to make my way through the rest of Sanderson’s Cosmere books. That obviously included reading his more acclaimed series, The Stormlight Archive. And although I now understand what the hype is about and I quite enjoyed this first book, I have to recognise that I didn’t love it as much as I expected.The Way of Kings is the first instalment of an epic fantasy ten-book series set in the world of Roshar. The book starts off with a prelude where we get to see how the Heralds, after years of deaths and rebirths to fight the Voidbringers, decide to sacrifice one of their own in order to set themselves free and disappear. Then, we are taken thousands of years later to the present timeline, where we meet the main characters of this high fantasy story: Kaladin, Shallan and Dalinar. Kaladin is a previous squadleader known as Stormblessed and a current slave sold to the Alethi army and forced to join Bridge Four, the worst bridge crew in the army of Highprince Sadeas. Shallan is the only daughter of the recently deceased Brightlord Davar of Jah Keved, who arrives to Kharbranth to become princess Jasnah Kholin’s ward under the pretext of wanting to be her student but secretly planning to steal her Soulcaster—a type of fabrial that allows people to Soulcast, changing one substance to another. Dalinar, also known as the Blackthorn, is a powerful Shardbearer and a Highprince of Alethkar who is currently having strange visions during highstorms.
“Sometimes,” Dalinar said, “the prize is not worth the costs. The means by which we achieve victory are as important as the victory itself.”
Two other relevant characters whose points of views are included in this first instalment are Szeth and Adolin. Szeth, the Truthless of Shinovar and also known as the Assassin in White, is a Shin who wilds a Shardblade and who killed King Gavilar of Alethkar. Adolin is Dalinar’s eldest son, a Brighlord and a Shardbearer. There are also some very interesting interludes through the book told from Szeth’s perspective and from other characters.I found all these characters quite interesting, but my favourite chapters were the ones told from Shallan’s and Szeth’s POVs. If I’m being honest with you, I didn’t empathize that much with the Veden woman at the beginning, but she started growing on me as the book progressed. Additionally, we get to know Jasnah through her perspective, who is probably my favourite character of the series so far. Other aspects that made me love Shallan’s POV are the setting and the information we get about the Voidbringers and Soulcasting. On the other hand, I enjoyed the small amount of Szeth’s chapters because of his interesting past and the enigmatic master behind the murders he has to commit. The Way of Kings has a vast world and I can only admire the work behind the documentation and creation of Roshar. But this instalment is mainly set in the Frostlands, specifically in the Shattered Plains and Kharbranth. The former is an uneven mosaic of different plateaus separated by chasms where Alethi and Parshendi fight over the gemhearts made from the chrysalises of the chasmfiends—huge crustacean-like creatures. While the latter is the main academic city in Roshar and within it is the most extensive library in the world. Kaladin’s and Dalinar’s perspectives take place in the Shattered Plains, while we get to know Kharbranth and its Palanaeum through Shallan’s POV.
“Money is behind every war,” Au-nak continued. “Religion is but an excuse. Or perhaps a justification.”
The main characters are from the former Vorin Kingdoms, which means that their culture follows a caste system based on the colour of the eyes where the lighteyes are the ruling class while the darkeyes are considered the lower caste in society. Both lighteyes and darkeyes have ten levels in their system of rank. In addition, Vorin women, especially lighteyes, have to cover their safehand (left hand) following the Vorin tradition. I personally can’t wait to see how this awful system is fought by the characters in the next books, which I’m sure will happen. Lastly but certainly not least, I would like to mention the spren, mystical creatures which either cause or are drawn to different conditions or emotions. They appear through the entire book but the reason I wanted to bring them up is because of Syl, a supposed windspren who enigmatically bonds with Kaladin at the very beginning of the story. I really enjoyed the dynamic between those two and I have the feeling that Syl is the key to know what really happened with the Knights Radiant thousand of years ago.Overall, I enjoyed The Way of Kings. It’s a complex first instalment in an epic fantasy series with a very promising premise. My only complaints are that I found it a little bit long, which made me struggle with some chapters, and that the pace was quite slow in some parts. Nevertheless, I’m looking forward to continuing the series and getting some answers about all the enigmas presented in this book, especially about the Parshendi. Even though this volume didn’t blow me away as much as I expected, I have high hopes regarding the next instalments.
“Tradition is the blind witness they use to condemn us, Teft,” Kaladin said. “It’s the pretty box they use to wrap up their lies. It makes us serve them.”

The Way of Kings,2,"I finally finished, halleluhjah. Only took me two years. I really did not enjoy this book. A lot of my friends love Brandon Sanderson to pieces. I am bowing out. Done, not going to pick up this author anytime soon. Endless, mind numbing details and blah blah blah. Sorry.Yes, lots of world building, great magic system, lots of good ideas and concepts. But eventually it all was just so boooooring. The book is long. Long book. It takes forever for something to happen. Long book is long. More plot would be better. A faster evolving plot would be better still.I started the ebook in May 2016, read about 200 pages and then stopped to pick up something shorter and more exciting sounding. I never went back to it. People kept raving about Sanderson and my buddies continued the series, full of enthusiasm. So, in another attempt at this I got the audiobook, all scary 45h 34m of it... I listened at 2x speed, to end my suffering sooner. I really had to force myself to pick this up every now and then and plow through another hour of it.Besides the ridiculous length, the institutionalized racism of the book really bugged me. Yes, it is obviously an integral part of the story, but I found it tiresome and the variance of human appearances unlikely. It somehow rubbed me the wrong way.I was also not a fan of how women were portrayed.Have I mentioned how boring I found the book for very long stretches of the way?And many characters were TSTL. I don’t expect this amount of stupid in a fantasy novel. And they all did too much navel-gazing. I don‘t care for pages and pages of what, if, why, if it leads to no action.What else? The book felt old-fashioned. Lack of humour, sarcasm or irony. Have I mentioned that the book is too long? And lacks action? Too much repetition and endless build-up? Boring?I am sooo glad I am done with this. I am now going to delete Warbreaker from my kindle. Tried Brandon Sanderson, done, thank you.1.5 very relieved-to-be-done-with-it stars"
The Way of Kings,2,"I admire Sanderson's ability to write quickly, but his nanowrimo-like approach has some serious drawbacks. And the flaws are readily and frequently apparent in this latest work of his. Now, the world I did find the story interesting, and will most likely continue reading the series, but I really wish Sanderson would slow down and improve the quality of his prose. For instance, every character's POV is littered with an overabundance of rhetorical questions which make the story sound amateurish and the characters' thought frequently redundant. Too many characters have similar reactions--sniffing or raising one eyebrow. Many of the female characters feel more Robert Jordan-esque: a woman famed for her wit and grace considers throwing a tantrum twice to have her way. And too many times a character says something dramatic and then jogs off. Too many scenes seem to reveal Sanderson striving to write to his outline, at the expense of things like character development, good dialogue, and plot progression. The prose is often overwritten. Phrases like ""as literal as the rocks themselves"" or ""waved curtly""or ""frowned in sorrow"" are puzzlingly bad. The dialogue suffers too: the scene where one character tells another ""My sense of honor makes me easy to manipulate"" is just sad. Creatures named the ""songlings"" won't ever be part of good world building. Parts of it aren't thought out either--a character who can't afford to heat his house is able to get drunk on strong wine. The plots seem contrived; a character drops something and the wind immediately picks up and blows it away. The characters aren't particularly interesting early on. The theology and philosophy are dumbed down and misrepresented to an embarrassing degree. Nearly ever character who is meant to be clever simply interprets words literally. This isn't clever, especially not after one or two times. Other mildly sarcastic remarks elicit surprised approval and comments on intelligence from onlookers. A supposedly clever character responds to her allies instruction of ""Keep your wits about you,"" with a joke about keeping her wits about her would mean that someone got too close with a cudgel. That's not witty, that's annoying. It's hard to believe that sarcasm is such a rare commodity in any world. A main character having an invisible fairy on his shoulder reminds me of the Secret of Mana, except that what works in a video game doesn't translate into the written world. On aspect of the world-building I like is the invention of new taboo words. But simply substituting ""storm"" in the same context as our bad words make his supposedly battle-hardened slaves sound unfortunately like the Smurfs. And putting your assassin in white clothes isn't inverting or playing with tropes, at least not in an interesting way. It's also creepy to read a book written by a Mormon with the question: ""What would the world be like if all men lived by the book?"" The addition of high-born women hiding their hand in sleeves is likewise reminiscent of funny mormon underwear. All that aside, I am interested in the world and the developments. I am curious about what happens next. I think this is a good story told poorly--with tighter prose and better editing, he could have had a 400 page book that would have stood as a new classic. As it is, Sanderson's ability to write so quickly is turning out to hurt him as much as it helps him."
The Way of Kings,3,"3.5 StarsI wanted so badly to love this super popular epic fantasy series so pains me to say that I thought it was just… okay. The writing and the characters were certainly fine, but I failed to get immersed in the story. Of the three main perspectives, I liked Kaladiin the most and felt his storyline was the most interesting. The magic system was pretty cool, but not as clearly explained to the reader as in other Sanderson books. I actually really liked the worldbuilding because I loved the idea of prehistoric rock monsters, but the story had too much setup and enough actual plot for my personal reading tastes. "
The Way of Kings,3,Giving this one another try with the massive group read https://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/...* * * * *Review moved to http://covers2covers.wordpress.com/20...
The Way of Kings,1,"Clearly in the minority of readers, I found this NY Times Best Seller ""epic fantasy"" to be a verbose, bloated, complex and disjointed mess with the characters going in circles, battle after battle, flashback after flash-forward, and constantly changing voices. It doesn't even begin to come together until about page 600, and even then it doesn't really ramp up for another 250 pages, with the final result being a giant prologue to his newest fantasy series. When the 1007 page novel finally ends it isn't really over and I don't care to read another 9,000 pages of sequels to reach the real conclusion. This is one novel that would benefit from a ruthless Reader Digest condensation.But don't decide to read it or not based upon my opinion as I'm definitely not an epic fantasy aficionado and 66% of Goodreads readers give it 5 stars; less than 1% give it 1 star. I give him high marks for masterfully crafting a complex fictional world of fauna, flora, terrains, extreme ecospheres, civilizations with multiple races, cultures, ethnicities and class structures, complete with its own Stormlight Series taboo words & phrases e.g. ""storm it"". Hey, there are even multiple palindromes. And as always, I give high praise for omitting all too common obscene language, vulgarities and gratuitous sex. (*This is a ""Squeaky Clean Reads"" book http://www.squeakycleanreads.com/)His overall theme is laudable: Life before death; strength before weakness; journey before destination. Still, the clever complexity feels more like schizophrenic disorganization. With so many books, and so little time, choose carefully."
Dune,4,"There's a characteristically witty essay by Borges about a man who rewrites Don Quixote, many centuries after Cervantes. He publishes a novel with the same title, containing the same words in the same order. But, as Borges shows you, the different cultural context means it's a completely new book! What was once trite and commonplace is now daring and new, and vice versa. It just happens to look like Cervantes's masterpiece.Similarly, imagine the man who was brave or stupid enough to rewrite Dune in the early 21st century. Like many people who grew up in the 60s and 70s, I read the book in my early teens. What an amazing story! Those kick-ass Fremen! All those cool, weird-sounding names and expressions they use! (They even have a useful glossary in the back). The disgusting, corrupt, slimy Harkonnens - don't you just love to hate them! When former-aristo-turned-desert-guerilla-fighter Paul Muad'Dib rides in on a sandworm at the end to fight the evil Baron and his vicious, cruel nephew, of course you're cheering for him. Who the hell wouldn't be?So that was the Dune we know and love, but the man who rewrote it now would get a rather different reception. Oh my God! These Fremen, who obviously speak Arabic, live on a desert planet which supplies the Universe with melange, a commodity essential to the Galactic economy, and in particular to transport. Not a very subtle way to say ""oil""! They are tough, uncompromising fighters, who are quite happy to use suicide bombing as a tactic. They're led by a charismatic former rich kid (OK, we get who you mean), who inspires them to rise up against the corrupt, degenerate... um, does he mean Westerners? Or only the US? And who is Baron Harkonnen intended to be? I'm racking my brains... Dubya doesn't quite seem to fit, but surely he means someone? Unless, of course, he's just a generic stereotype who stands for the immoral, sexually obsessed West. This is frightening. What did we do to make Frank al-Herbert hate us so much? You'd have people, not even necessarily right-wingers, appearing on TV to say that the book was dangerous, and should be banned: at the very least, it incites racial hatred, and openly encourages terrorism. But translations would sell brilliantly in Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, and a bad movie version would soon be made in Turkey.I honestly don't think Herbert meant any of that; but today, it's almost impossible not to wonder. If anyone reading this review is planning to rewrite The Tale of Benjamin Bunny, you'd better make sure you get your timing right. Who knows how it will be interpreted five years from now?"
Dune,2,"No one should argue the importance Dune. It laid the foundations for a great deal of the themes and constructs in modern science fiction. Frank Herbert was as important to the genre as Isaac Asimov and Arthur Clarke. Unfortunately, just like them, he's quite dated, and his books can be a labor to read. One thing he maintained from old science fiction was prim and scientific dialogue that no one would ever actually speak. I've known many scientists, and they don't talk like this. You're not going to convince me a child does.The stuffy dialogue is inserted into even stuffier narrative, until it feels like nothing is organic about Herbert's prose. This is a terrible tragedy when you've got a world that he put so much effort into building - and it is an amazing feat of world-building, technically interplanetary building. But unlike J.R.R. Tolkien, who he is so frequently compared to, Herbert didn't make sure to include a great story in his world. Instead he included a story that frequently illustrated how clunky an artificial world can be, even if it's lovingly crafted. I struggled to attach or find interest in anyone, yet they're more archetypes than human beings, whose logic races past modern skepticism and whose dialogue is cloyingly artificial, the way people cared for the Hobbits, Dwarves and Rangers. In his world-building, Tolkien at least saved himself from being dated by antedating himself, and even with his illuminated prose, wrought more characteristics in just one protagonist than all of Dune's cast. Even the political intrigue Herbert tries to fall back on was overdone in the Spy genre decades before he started this book. All fans of the ""Genre"" genres should appreciate Herbert's massive contributions, but they shouldn't pretend to enjoy the books if they don't, and they should be wary of certain pitfalls typical of science fiction that survived into his landmark work."
Dune,2,"Nope. Sorry I don't get it.I was able to finish it by listening to the audiobook but I was bored throughout the whole 21h.So many descriptions... anyone else found the way Paul's mom describing him kinda weird?And let's not even mention how many times I laughed at the main female character being called Jessica.I'm sure I'll get plenty of comments telling me it's a classic and it brought so much to the genre... At the end of the day, my rating is always based on my enjoyment."
Dune,5,"In my head, the purpose of this review is very clear. It is to convince YOU to read this book. Yes, you! Waste time no more. Go grab a copy.Machiavellian intrigue, mythology, religion, politics, imperialism, environmentalism, the nature of power. All this set in a mind-boggling, frighteningly original world which Herbert ominously terms as an ""effort at prediction"". Dune had me hooked!First impressionThe very first stirring I felt upon opening the yellowed pages of Dune was that of stumbling upon an English translation of an ancient Arabic manuscript of undeniable power and potence which had an epic story to narrate. The tone was umistakably sombre and I realized Herbert was not here to merely entertain me, he was here to make me part of the legend of Muad'Dib. It was intriguing and challenging and heck, since I live for challenges I decided to take this one up too, gladly. The challenge was the complexity and depth of the plot, which left me perplexed, in the beginning. I knew there were dialogues which meant much more than their superficial meaning and was unable to grasp at it. I felt a yawning chasm between Herbert's vision and my limited understanding of it. However, of course, I plodded on and could feel the gap closing in with every page much to my joy and relief. The Foreword""To the people whose labours go beyond ideas into the realm of 'real materials'- to the dry-land ecologists, wherever they may be, in whatever time they work, this effort at prediction is dedicated in humility and admiration."" The foreword makes it pretty clear that Frank Herbert isn't kidding around. This is a serious effort at predicting how our world is going to look two thousand years from now and by God, it's a bloody good and detailed prediction. However, the real merit in this effort lies in the commentary on our lives in the present.Why Frank Herbert is a geniusThe setting of the book is arid futuristic. the plot is driven by political mind games reminiscent of The Game of Thrones. The issues he tackles are as modern as the colour television. Herbert's genius manifests itself in his ability to combine the past, the present and the future in one sweeping elegant move called Dune.Plot and SettingDune is set in a futuristic technologically advanced world which after the Butlerian Jihad (the bloody war between Man and Machines) has eliminated all computers and passed a decree declaring ""Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a man's mind"". Since there are no computers, the essential working of the galaxy is still medieval and feudal with heavy reliance on men and their dallying around. Lots of thriller potential right there. Men with superhuman analytical abilities called Mentats have taken the place of Computers. On the other hand, we have the Bene Gesserit, an ancient school of mental and physical training for female students (it gives them superhuman intuitive powers) who follow a selective breeding program which makes them feared and mistrusted through the Imperium. Their desired end product of this breeding program is the Kwisatz Haderach, a superman who’ll be able to glimpse into the future. How he’ll be able to do this is rooted in Herbert’s idea of determinism: given that one can observe everything and analyze everything, one can effectively glimpse the future in probabilistic terms. Quantum physics anyone? The Kwisatz Haderach is the proposed solution to the male-female dichotomy, between the analytical and intuitive.The plot of Dune is almost wholly set on the desert planet of Arrakis (also referred to as Dune), an arid wasteland where water is so scarce that men have to wear stillsuits which recycle human moisture for further consumption. The source of the galaxy’s interest in the planet is Melange, a spice which bestows upon one longevity and prescient powers. Everything on the planet is permeated with the spice, the air, the sand, the food. Everybody on the planet is hopelessly addicted to the spice, their only hope for survival being their continued intake of the spice. The Spacing Guild, the economic and trading monopolistic arm of the Galaxy badly needs the spice for interstellar transport. This is because their frigates travel faster than the speed of light and hence travel backward in time. The spice is the only way they can look into the future and see their way ahead. How cool is that! All the powers on the Galaxy are out to mine the spice, braving the sandworms, their name merely an euphemism, for they are gigantic 200 metre long creatures which always come digging through the sand whenever spice mining is undertook. Always. There’s also another little glitch. There exist on the planet, the kickass native desert tribal Fremen, whom the foreign powers look down with suspicion and disdain. The Fremen ethos is one of survival and scarcity, driven by tribalism and egalitarianism. Okay, I’ll stop right there. No more spoilers about this. Except that they value water to the extent that spitting on a person is the highest honour they can bestow upon him.Our protagonists are the Atreides family, consisting of the Duke, his Bene Gesserit concubine Jessica and their son Paul, who have been entrusted the stewardship of Arrakis. We discover the alien planet of Arrakis along with them, firstly with fear, suspicion and wonder and ultimately, love and respect. Paul Muad’Dib, however is no ordinary prince. There’s a teeny weeny chance he might be the Kwisatz Haderach, something which troubles him constantly and gives us our conflicted hero. The poor chap trips balls over the spice and has visions of black hordes pillaging and murdering around town bearing his flag and sees his dead body multiple times.My favourite character, however has to be the Baron Vladmir Harkonnen, the most evil character I’ve ever come across in my literary excursions. He is ruddy ruthlessness, he is virile villainy, he is truculent treachery. He executes the inept chess players in his employ which says oodles about his badassery and his fondness for cold-blooded logic. He sees everything in simplistic chess terms. What is my best move? What is my opponent’s best move? Is there anything I can do to completely squash his move? Is there a tactic which leads to mate in three? ThemesIn this setting, Herbert does so much, it’s unbelievable. Religion, politics, the dynamic nature of power, the effects of colonialism, our blatant destruction of our environment are themes which run parallel to the intensely exciting and labyrinthine plot. He shows the paramount importance of myth making and religion for power to sustain over long periods of time. Man, as a political animal is laid completely bare.Real lifeNow these are my thoughts about what Herbert could have meant to be Arrakis- It makes perfect sense. Herbert draws heavy inspiration for the religious ideology of Muad’Dib from Islam. He says “When religion and politics ride in the same cart and that cart is driven by a living Holy man, nothing can stand in the path of such a people.” which is the philosphy of the politics of Islam. Islamism in a nutshell. The spice, much desired by everyone, is the oil. Baron Vladmir Harkonnen is symblomatic of the wily Russians. The Desert foxes Fremen are representative of the native Saudi desert-dwelling Bedouin tribe who have a strongly tribe-oriented culture and undoubtedly value water in equal measure. And the ultimate loser is the environment.Why do good books get over?I almost forget this is a science fiction novel, it’s that real. It is also scary and prophetic. It is a reading experience that will leave you dreaming of the grave emptiness of Arrakis and make you wish you were there to brave it all in the privileged company of the noble Fremen. Frank Herbert achieves the pinnacle of what a sci-fi author aspires to rise to; authentic world building."
Dune,4,"LOOK DAMN IT! OMG!Mel 🖤🐶🐺🐾••••••••••••••••I was so worried that I wouldn't understand a thing in this book. I will admit there are some things that went over my head but for the most part I figured it out. I remember a billion and 65 years ago I watched the movie and was like what the? Basically all I remember is Sting and sandworms. I would love to watch it again and see if I understand it more after reading the book. I'm still not sure what all the spices were about on Arrakis. I keep thinking it's like their farming like we would farm corn or tobacco, etc. I could be wrong and I didn't get the connection between the spice and the sandworms. Is it like a drug to them? I did read in the back of the book that is was like a drug when taken in small quantities and really addictive when taken in large quantities and that Muad'Did felt his prophesies were because of the spice. I liked Duke Leto and I hated that he was betrayed not long after they got to Arrakis. There is always some twat out there causing trouble. I really enjoyed Paul's character and his mother Jessica. They seemed like really strong people and adapted very well in everything they were put through. I didn't really pay too much attention to the other characters or I guess I should say I didn't have many thoughts about them. With the exception of the ones that betrayed them. I really enjoyed when Paul and Jessica had to travel to get away from the evil Baron Harkonnen before they were killed too. I don't know why, but I enjoyed their little journey. I think they were both great in their roles when they were found by the Freman and showed they were a force to be reckoned with. Now maybe I'm getting this all wrong but I'm trying to tell it through the way I saw it in my mind. I don't understand how Paul's sister, Alia, was an abomination. That one must have went over my head too. It might have had something to do with the poison Jessica took to become the Reverend Mother. I'm not sure but I know some of my goodreads friends that read this will get me sorted out =)Other than the sandworms and traitorous people on Arrakis, I was most freaked out by the thought of the water issue! I would NOT was to live somewhere there was a water shortage. And the part where they were talking about selling foot water, I can't even. Which basically means your stinky foot sweat! Overall I really liked the book. I enjoyed traipsing through this desert with Paul and his mother. Only in book form though, not in real life! Since they are doing re-makes of about a million different movies, I wish they would re-make this one because I think it would be really awesome! I would like to see this land come to life in today's time! I don't know if I'm going to continue with the series as I have heard this is the best one and the others get confusing. But I would like to see how Paul is as a ruler and what all happens to them, or maybe not depending on what all happens. If anyone can answer any of the things I was confused with that would be helpful =)Also, I have seen some pictures on here of this really cool Dune book with art in it. Does anyone have a link of where to get that book or is it still available? Thank you :-)MY BLOG: Melissa Martin's Reading List"
Dune,5,"Dune.No other single syllable means as much to the science fiction genre, a single word that conjures images of sandworms, spice wars, great battles between rival dynastic families and a massively detailed and intricately crafted universe. No wonder this is widely regarded as not just a Science Fiction masterpiece, but a literary achievement as well. Like a study of Shakespeare, the reader finds that this is an archetype upon which many influences and imitators have based their works. The complexity and depth of the creation is staggering and I am continually astounded at the discipline with which Herbert must have focused his imagination.This is the book upon which Herbert would base his greatest series and one that would outlive him as his son has continued to expand and add detail to the vast, immaculate tapestry woven by a true master of the genre. Encapsulating political, economic, sociological, biological, cultural and dynastic themes, Frank Herbert has set a high standard for later practitioners.Brilliant.***2015 reread - Read years later, this has lost none of its narrative power, if anything I can better appreciate the virtuoso attention to detail Herbert exhibited in his epic creation. From the perspective of having read his later 5 Dune sequels, I am astounded at the rich tapestry he has woven. Most impressive was his close omnipresence, analyzing the thoughts and minute actions and subtle nuances of his complicated dynamic interplay of characters. The exhaustive training of the Bene Gesserit and the intricate relations of the Houses and the Guild would stand as a monumental benchmark for speculative fiction ever since.This time around I found myself looking more closely at the Harkonnens and will likely read some of Brian Herbert's additions to his fathers great work.***2019 reread - I'm even more in love with this book and am again in awe of Herbert's narrative skill. This time around I noticed that all of the quotes that begin chapters are from Princess Irulan and I paid close attention to how Herbert crafted these interludes.I also was drawn to the religious undertones that really began very early in the book and how Paul realized his gifts and was preparing for his role in the beginning chapters - all demonstrating Herbert's great narrative skill.Finally, I became more aware of what a great character was Gurney Halleck. While the ghola of Duncan Idaho dominated the later books, Herbert's creation of Halleck was an enjoyable and thought provoking addition to this masterpiece. "
Dune,1,"If this is the gold standard against which all science fiction must measure and be judged, let's just blow our brains out right now and call it a day. As far as I can tell, Dune largely inspires two points of view. One marvels at its historical importance and world-building (unique, fascinating, complex, rich), and the other dislikes the stilted writing but does so apologetically because Frank Herbert couldn't help the fact that he wrote science fiction in the 1960s and that Edward Said hadn't done his thing yet. Come  on , people of the world. Linear models of progress don't apply to good writing. Frank Herbert can't write because he's a shitty writer, not because it was the 1960s. The dialogue is clunky and characters have endless internal monologues (in italics) that serve no purpose but to explain incredibly obvious plot points to the reader. This is an embarrassingly novice mistake. The plot also lacks any element of surprise. Princess Irulan, oblivious to the concept of spoiler alerts, summarizes all major plot points in her historical vignettes which introduce every single chapter. We can't wonder about whether and how  Jesus Christ  Paul will become the messiah of the people because the princess has already told us before we've begun the book. We can't wonder about who the traitor in the Atreides house is because Princess Irulan's vignette is all like ""Yueh! Yueh! A million deaths were not enough for Yueh!"" And then there's the world-building. It is So. Fucking. Lazy. Half the words are lifted from Arabic and  Arab  Fremen culture is the result of a scavenger rampage through Islamic concepts, scraps of Buddhism, and Frank Hebert's Orientalist curiosities all cobbled together into a cringe-inducing whole. The main subject of this book, the  sand niggers  Fremen, have been in the desert for thousands of years, border on religious fanaticism, and haven't changed a bit over time. They pray salat, conserve water (because hello, desert), and wait for their white savior Paul to bring them out into the light (or into the shade, as it were). They frequently declare Muslim-sounding things in bastardized Arabic and are very upset because the Imperial forces are preventing them from doing Haj. It's unclear how the Imperial forces have blocked all outbound flights to Saudi Arabia, but we'll take it on faith. There was a jihad situation, like, hundreds of years ago but it was apparently a jihad against computers? I don't know. The  ragheads  Fremen also do this thing where two men will fight to the death and the winner will take the dead man's woman as his wife or his servant.  Given the history of the U.S., I think it's hilarious that a book full of racism, imperialism, and misogyny was considered groundbreaking in the 1960s. The other thing that makes this book unreadable is Frank Herbert's I-Tarzan-You-Jane approach to gender:“There is in each of us an ancient force that takes and an ancient force that gives. A man finds little difficulty facing that place within himself where the taking force dwells, but it’s almost impossible for him to see into the giving force without changing into something other than man. For a woman, the situation is reversed … The greatest peril to the Giver is the force that takes. The greatest peril to the Taker is the force that gives."" Man has the mighty penis. Mighty penis does the thrusting action. Woman has the sacred hole. Sacred hole is warm and open for mighty penis penetration. Thanks for clearing that up, Frank. Male and female characters in this book align nicely with Frank's pole-in-hole view of the world. The men do the war because the penis. The women do the manipulation and mind control because the vagina. They are either wives or concubines, and having children is of utmost important. Man and his woman sometimes have tender conversations about all of this. Observe: ""[Paul] began tightening his still suit. ""You told me once the words of Kitab al-Ibar,"" he said. ""You told me: 'Woman is thy field; go then to thy field and till it.'"" ""I am the mother of thy firstborn,"" she agreed."" How romantic. Anyway, let's talk some more about Paul, our white messiah. When he's taking a break from tilling his fields, he's busy being a cartoon hero. He has no flaws. Like, none. He sees everything, understands everything, knows the future, and every word out of his mouth is prophetic and vaguely Shakespearean. This is the kind of shit he says: [Re. aforementioned penis/vagina theory] """"And you, my son,"" Jessica asked, ""are you one who gives or one who takes?"" ""I'm at the fulcrum,"" he said. ""I cannot give without taking and I cannot take without [giving].""""You're SIXTEEN, bitch. Sit down and shut the fuck up. Nobody cares. Opposite the cartoon hero is the cartoon villain. He's really, really evil. He wakes up evil, goes to bed evil, and all the time in the middle, he has evil conversations and evil thoughts. Many of his evil thoughts are in italics so we know EXACTLY where the story is headed because plot twists are also evil and will not be tolerated. Please note, he is also fat as fuck and eats a lot. Also, he's a big homo. And the homo's a pedo. I really have nothing more to say. I AM glad I took the time to wade through this shitstorm of misogyny and orientalism. You can't read sci-fi and not have read Dune. I always suspected I might hate it, but at least now I have proof. "
Dune,3,"People often forget that this series is what innovated our modern concept of science fiction (up until Neuromancer and The Martix, at least). Dune took the Space Opera and asked if it might be more than spandex, dildo-shaped rockets, and scantily-clad green women. Herbert created a vast and complex system of ancient spatial politics and peoples, then set them at one another's throats over land, money, and drugs.Dune is often said to relate to Sci Fi in the same way that Tolkien relates to Fantasy. I'd say that, as far as paradigm shift, this is widely true. Both entered genres generally filled with the odd, childish, and ridiculous and injected a literary sensibility which affected all subsequent authors.Few will challenge the importance of Star Wars' effect on film and storytelling in general, but without Dune, there would be no Star Wars. Princess Alia, the desert planet, the Spice, the Bene Gesserit, and Leto II all have direct descendants in the movies. It is unfortunate that Lucas seems to have forgotten in these later years that his best genius was pilfered from Herbert, Campbell, and Kurosawa.Though I have heard that the later books do not capture the same eclectic energy as the first, Dune itself is simply one of the most original and unusual pieces of Sci Fi ever written. Read it, Starship Troopers, Ringworld, Neuromancer, and Snowcrash and you'll know everything you need to about Sci Fi: that you want more."
Dune,5,"Update 8/28/17Re-read. Number 13. :) I cry when Paul meets Gurney. I shiver when Jessica consoles Chani. I'm awestruck by the peaks and troughs of time, free-will, and the weakness in Paul even as he heroically strives against the evil that is about to be unleashed upon the universe. *sigh*Perfection. Easily the number one book I've ever read. :)I waver, sometimes, but right now, it is my absolute favorite. :)Original Review:This is a phenomenal classic of literature.It's not just science fiction. It transcends science fiction, as a fascinating discussion of free-will versus inevitability. Can the Jihad be denied? Can Paul ever really avoid his own death, despite seeing every time-line play out with him as the butt of every cosmic joke? Can even cruelty or mercy even remain comprehensible after such knowledge?Yes, I think this work outdoes Nietzsche. It certainly does a great job of making us care about the question.Is this all? Is this just a work that pays great justice to philosophy of action and inaction? Or is the novel merely a clever play at turning the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle into the physical embodiment of a man? It is that, of course. The Kwisatz Haderach can be many places at once, and he can be both alive and dead at the same time just like that certain cat.Is the novel a coming of age tale, first set as a mirror against his father Leto, only then to mirror the whole universe that had just turned against him? Yes, of course. He was, after all, both the product of all his upbringing and his genes, embodying the question of nature versus nurture. He was taught within many schools of martial arts and assassins, as well as training the mind in both the schools of the Mentats with their pure logic and that of the mystics, the Bene Gesserit, that allows complete control over the body down to the cellular level. And if this training wasn't enough, he was deeply schooled in politics, leadership, and the meaning of loyalty. The boy was raised right. Of course, that is nothing without ninety generations of genetic bloodline tampering from the Bene Gesserit, right? To become the fulcrum between cellular memory, tapping the minds and lives of all your genetic ancestors as well as tapping the ability to fold time and space, to become the eye of a storm of time.What a damn brilliant setup for one tiny character, no? His training links to the unlocking of his genes and to the life-extending and enveloping spice, Melange, to make him not merely aware of time in a theoretical sense, but eventually to be unable to discern what was in the past, the present, or the future. Here's a true Super-Man, well beyond Nietzsche.And don't believe for one second that this serious discussion about what would make a superior man makes for dull reading. No. We've got PLOT that's probably some of the most exciting and visceral in all of literature, driving us right into the web of intrigue, vengeance, treachery, and galactic politics. To quote the text, we've got ""Plans within Plans,"" and it hardly stops there. We know the House Atreides is falling into a trap laid by the Emperor and House Harkonnen, and yet free-will and pride prevents any chance to avoid it. The setup is brilliant and extremely political, giving us character sketches of some of the most brilliant and memorable characters of all time.Duke Leto, the Red Duke, the most honorable and beloved leader.Duncan Idaho, the emotional and intuitive hero.Gurney Halleck, archetypal loyalist and troubadour.Lady Jessica, the woman who ought to have had all honor in life, but was unjustly reviled and set aside for political necessity. (Chani being both her mirror and her eventual glory.)And of course, my favorite character of all time, Paul Muad'dib Atreides, the one that would prevent the greater evils he foresaw, and went to enormous lengths and sacrifice to achieve, but who eventually failed in his task because even a god cannot overcome destiny. (Or the will of so many minds set as one.)So damn brilliant.Frank Herbert spent five years writing this treasure, working and reworking it until he published it at age 25. None of his other works come close to this masterpiece, and there's little wonder. It was birthed, fully-formed, like Athena from Zeus's head, with enormous forethought and care. The worldbuilding was just as carefully formed, from the ecology of Arrakis and the life-cycles of the sandworms, to the history and the creation of the Fremen from their mild beginnings as Zensunni Wanderers, adherents to the Orange Catholic Bible, to their history of oppression so like those of those who are Jewish, to their settling and hardening of their bodies and souls in the wastes of Arrakis, also just like the Jewish who carved out a place for themselves in Israel. (Current politics aside, this was a very potent idea before 1965 when Herbert wrote this, and indeed, the core is still just as powerful when you turn it back to Muslims.)The Galactic culture is rich and detailed. The CHOAM economic consortium, with their monopoly on space travel and their need for the Spice to allow them to see a short period into the future to plot a safe course before folding space. The Empire is caught on a knife's edge between a single power and every other House who sit in the possibility of putting aside all their squabbles for the sole purpose of checking the Emperor, if they so desired. (And Duke Atreides was such a possible popular leader among all the Great Houses, which was the primary reason the Emperor wanted him dead.) And of course, we have our Villains. The Baron Harkonnen has always been a crowd pleaser. Brilliant in his own right, devious and able to corrupt anyone with just the right sorts of pressure, including a certain absolutely trustworthy doctor we might mention.""The Tooth! The Tooth!"" -- You can't handle the Tooth!Feyd Rautha Harkonnen is especially interesting for the question of nature versus nurture.The Bene Gesserit had intended him to mate with Paul, who should have been Leto and Jessica's daughter, and that offspring should have been the cumulation of ninety years of a breeding experiment to recreate the Kwisatz Haderach which had come about almost by accident during the Butlerian Jihad in the deep past, to overthrow the AI overlords.He was practically Paul's genetic twin, or at least, his potential to be the ""One who can be many places at once"" was on par with Paul. But instead of fulfilling the kind of destiny that we get with Paul, we see him grow up under the auspices of his Uncle the Baron, becoming as cruel and devious as he was deadly. He was the argument of nurture in the conversation, of course, and having so very little of it eventually cost him his life.I often wonder about the directions that Dune could have taken, all those little paths in time and circumstance that could have been. What if Feyd had been brought to Arrakis earlier and overwhelmed with Spice the way that Paul had? Sure, he wouldn't have been able to convert the unconscious changes into conscious manipulation, but he might have had enough glimpses of the future, the way that the Fremen did, to have given him the edge he would have needed to kill Paul.And then there's a relatively minor character, Hasimir Fenring, the Emperor's personal assassin, who was nearly the Kwisatz Haderach, himself. Unable to breed true, he was still potent enough to be completely hidden to Paul's time-sight in the same way that Paul was hidden from the Spacing Guild's weaker time-sight. His training as a skilled killer was also superior to Paul. He was, by all the hints and tricks in the tale, Paul's perfect downfall. It always gives me shivers to think about, and it was only in a single instant of both recognition and pity from Paul that stayed Fenring from killing our hero. It was just a moment of whim.The setup was gorgeous. Paul's pity, had it been missing at his moment of greatest triumph over the Emperor, would have meant Paul's assured death. I still wonder, to this day, what stayed Frank Herbert's hand from killing his most wonderful darling. We knew the pressure of religion and politics was going to have its way upon all the oppressed peoples of Dune. The return of a monstrous religious Jihad was going to happen one way or another, sweeping across the galaxy and toppling the Empire, regardless of Paul's frantic plans and desires. Paul's own death would only mean a higher level of fanaticism, and Frank Herbert's warning against unreasoning devotion would have been made even clearer with Paul's death.Perhaps it was pity that stayed his hand. Who are we to say who lives and who dies?If you really think this review is overlong, then I apologize, but please understand that I could absolutely go on and on much longer than this. It is a symptom of my devotion to this most brilliant of all tales.And yes, it still holds up very, very well after twelve reads. I am quite shocked and amazed."
Dune,4,"Ok, my only reference for Dune was the 1984 movie with Kyle MacLachlan. And, honestly, it was the main reason I've always wanted to read this book.Ohmygod look what that fake-looking piece of plastic shit is doing to poor MacLachlan's nose? How was he even able to act with that thing pushing his nostrils to the side of his face? I can't stop looking at it!Anyway.I remember loving that movie when I was young. Ahhhh. I honestly didn't remember much about it other than it was sorta weird, there were giant worms, a bunch of people had glowing blue eyes, and Sting was in it.After listening to this audiobook, I decided to rewatch the movie and relive the good times. Wow. Just wow. What in the holy hell did I just watch? Because whatever it was, it certainly didn't have much to do with the actual book. There were some fucking weird changes that they made to the movie that really didn't do anything for the plot. Like that gross dude with the shit in his face that flew around in that goofy air suit?In the book, he's just a fat dude!And that thing they do where they all have drain plugs attached to their hearts?Not in the book, either!In fact, none of that fucknut crazy/gross sci-fi shit is in the book.Blowing shit up with their voice guns? Nope.Bald Bene Gesserits? Nope.Bugs with butthole mouths? Nope.Mentat's with clip-on eyebrows who drink juice that gives them herpes lips? Nope.Captain Jean-Luc Picard going into battle with a pug? Fuck no!The list goes on and on...Not that it should matter. But it does! Because I was expecting something realllyreallyreally different, and if you go into this (like me) you may end up...well, not disappointed but maybe shocked? Having said that, I think the book was definitely better. There was no reason for ass-mouth monsters or oily rock stars in weird rubber underwear. It just makes a lot more sense the way Herbert wrote it. It's a magic is science tale set in space with an incredibly interesting look at how politics and religion can hold hands with each other and make war babies. I can see why people rave about it. It's honestly an incredibly insightful novel.You know, if you're into that sort of thing... A little dense, but worth it. But dense. That's worth saying twice because this thing is massive and you may get lost in it if giant word monsters aren't your jam when it comes to reading. I listened to the Audible version which is 21 HOURS (and 2 minutes!) long and might be the way to go for anyone looking for the easy way out.And I am ALWAYS looking for the easy way out."
Dune,4,"I’m sort of tempted to try this again. I don’t think it’ll be worth the hassle though. I could never give Dune five stars because I really struggled to get into the novel in the beginning. It has taken me almost two months to read. This, for me, is a very long time to spend on a book. It took me so long to read because I found the writing style incredibly frustrating. I had to read whole chapters again so I could get the gist of the plot. This was more so in the beginning, which I found particularly hard to read because of the author’s way of shifting between the thoughts of multiple characters. I found this very annoying; however, I persevered over my initial despondency towards the writing, and plodded on through the book. I’m glad I did so because in the end I did come to really enjoy it. Indeed, the story is fantastic, but the writing will always remain unbearable for me.  A truly brilliant plot Dune is to science fiction what The Lord of the Rings is to high fantasy; it is the novel that officially, and unarguably, defines the genre. The story begins with the house of Atreides accepting the Dukedom of the planet Dune. The former Baron has been ousted by the Emperor, and is no longer of consequence. Well, that is how it initially appears. Very early on it revealed that the whole thing is a political ploy to bring the house of Atreides to its knees. The Baron lies in wait, and is ready to strike against the new, and benevolent, approach the Duke uses on the Fremen. The Fremen are the natives of the dessert planet; thus, they know how to survive its harshness above all others. They do this through their frugal approach to water. They value it above all else, and will never waste a drop in earnest. The Baron Harkonnen, as a chide against the natives, squanders water in the cruellest ways. He, and his dinner guests, throw cups of water on the floor of the dinner hall; it was his tradition. The wasted water was soaked up with towels, which the Baron allowed the Fremen to suck the water out of. When the Duke enters he rejects this custom, and is more respectful to the Fremen way of life. He and his son and heir Paul, who is the protagonist of this novel, go as far as to try the Fremen’s grossly effective water saving suits. These Stillsuits, quite literally, recycle all the water the body wastes and feeds it back to its wearer. The Fremen way is the right wayThis early familiarity, with the Fremen technology, no doubt helps to keep Paul’s mind open when he is later forced to live amongst the Fremen. Paul is somewhat of a marvel; he is prophecy’s chosen one. When he eventually gains the trust of the Fremen they allow him to choose a Fermen name. He calls himself after their most revered prophet: Muad'Dib. They accept this and follow him as their leader. His inherited title of Duke dictates that he is their lord, but their religion determines their real loyalty. He has to, quite literally, fight for every ounce of their trust. Indeed, it does not come cheap, and will only be given to one who is a member of their people. “Without change something sleeps inside us, and seldom awakens. The sleeper must awaken.”Thus, Paul becomes their saviour. Consequently, he receives heaps of character development through this book. He goes form boy to the revered leader of a nation. The Fremen, like Paul, want the evil Baron Harkonnen gone from their planet. They do no want a cruel oppressor who is ignorant to their ways: they want Paul. I think the imagination behind the Fremen culture really is wonderful. They have efficiently adapted to survive their harsh planet. To emphasise this point you need only look at the fact that off-world humans live in fear of the giant Sandworms that infect the planet whereas the Fremen ride them as a coming of age ritual. Indeed, Paul has to ride a worm if the Fremen are to follow him. Deep characters The result of this is a very complex, and intriguing plot. I found the first third of this book to be very perplexing initially. This is a world we are told about rather than shown at the start. We hear about the Fremen but do not truly understand them till the very end. I was very overwhelmed at the beginning, and in all honesty I do think this novel merits a re-read to further establish my understanding of it. This did affect my rating because it inhibited by enjoyment of the book. “Deep in the human unconscious is a pervasive need for a logical universe that makes sense. But the real universe is always one step beyond logic.”Indeed, aside from Paul there is a whole host of dynamic, and well rounded, characters. His mother is to be the new revered mother of the Fremen people, which for someone of her age is quite remarkable. There is also the captain of Duke Leto’s household guard who is a very deep and honourable individual. As much as I came to like these characters I was still frustrated with the writing of them in the beginning. I found it difficult to read scenes in which up to four characters internal thoughts are portrayed alongside their dialogue. It wasn’t always clear who was thinking. I much prefer a narrative that is focalised through one person. Well, at least one person per chapter.  Overall, I thought the idea behind this novel was utterly fantastic. However, my personal reaction to the writing style limited my overall enjoyment of the book. I do intend to read some of the sequels. However, I do not have any intention of doing so in the near future. Maybe, in a couple of years I will return to the brilliant, and annoyingly written, world of Dune.Postscript: I thought |I’d show of some more pictures of my beautiful folio society edition of Dune. Also, all of the pictures (except the first) in my review are from the artwork in this edition. Enjoy!    "
Dune,4,"I blame the movie.I was an avid but novice fantasy and sci-fi reader in 1984 when David Lynch’s Dune rolled out as a big-budget adaptation of the 1965 classic book. It was an artistic and box-office failure with Roger Ebert calling it “a real mess, an incomprehensible, ugly, unstructured, pointless excursion.” Numerous references were made to its excessive length, particularly a tv edition that was over 3 hours long. I never did pick up the classic sci-fi book, assuming the commentary heard about the movie applied to the book. All that changed when I broke my finger and found myself with a lot of extra time on my hands (groan).Besides, sandworms. Dune has a lot of ingredients that don’t fit into my preferred stories, yet the gestalt was not only tolerable, but engrossing. It begins with the Atreides family preparing to shift their holding from their current home to the planet of Arrakis. The Emperor has given the Atreides the territory and trade on the planet of Arrakis, formerly under control of their enemies, the Harkonnen. The planet Arrakis is hot, arid and generally hostile to life. There is, however, a small population of native, fierce Freman who have managed to build an existence in the desert. Paul Atreides is the young heir of the family, and mystical testing reveals he might be the one prophesied. Paul undergroes a rapid growth curve, facilitated by his teacher Dr. Yeuh and his father’s advisors. But it is in the desert that Paul will discover his strength as well as his new people. Seriously, now.Honestly, I have to wonder how much of this like is generational. If Sanderson or Rothfuss wrote this book, two chapters in Dune would have made a whole book, and while detail may have been added, it likely would have made for a book as slow as the movie. I liked the scope of Dune, and that there is a resolution to the initial conflict. It is also interesting that despite the volume of concepts packed in here, with political maneuvers, terraforming, technology, cultural assimilation, and mysticism all playing roles that I didn’t find it overwhelming, perhaps because so much is genre-familiar. On the downside, it could have perhaps used a bit more transitions, particularly near the end when months at a time are skipped. Writing was solid; nothing really stood out, but it told the story well. There’s some vague mysticism that might irritate those who like explanations. It was a bit of an eye-roller to have the chief villain be a fat, gay, sadistic pedophile, but Herbert really isn’t thinking outside the trope character box much (it’s not enough that he sentences people to death but he has to be physically abhorrent? And gay?). World-building is fun, but standard desert.Overall, I’m glad that I finally took the time to read it and put those old assumptions to rest. I love a good hero. "
Dune,4,"
“I have seen a friend become a worshiper, he thought.”
I don’t think I actually *enjoyed* this book. But I certainly respected the hell out of it. For a bit I thought I had it all figured out, pegged it as your bog-standard Chosen One story, and then it went where I didn’t think it’d go and neatly subverted my expectations. It tackled stuff that is uncomfortable and therefore is generally handwaved over in the usual SF epics. And for that I seriously respected this dense complex tome. We people tend to love the idea of a charismatic all-powerful leader who inspires faithful following and true fervor, that cult-like blind devotion. We give those leaders tremendous power to lead and decide and determine fates. So many stories rooted in the weight of our species collective history glorify this; so many countries still apparently yearn for powerful visionary leaders that others proclaim to be dictators. So many religions go to wars over the legacy left by a popular charismatic leader centuries ago, interpreting those legacies as the engine for the action, destruction, obedience.Hero worship. Messianic worship. Prophecies and tyrannies. Desire for a Savior to rescue you from the evil. Good intentions paving the road to hell. It all leads to terrifying places which we may be powerless to stop.
“A leader, you see, is one of the things that distinguishes a mob from a people. He maintains the level of individuals. Too few individuals, and a people reverts to a mob.” This is a novel of a reluctant Messiah, the journey of a man becoming the Chosen One — but unlike the traditional story of a charismatic savior, this is a darker picture of the dangers of messianism and hero worship, of allowing blind devotion replace common sense. The book ends in an ambiguous place, and I presume the sequels may develop the theme or run away from it and make this a more traditional hero journey. But I certainly hope not. Because the dark implications of messianism say more about human nature than the happier stories based on the same idea, but with more idealism. We love our ideas of ideal benevolent rulers who can set things right, don’t we? Or the martyr figures inspiring “righteous” battles? Messiahs and figureheads seem to fulfill the deep-seated cultural longing for an inspirational leader, don’t they? Friends become followers and worshippers, and the metaphorical slope becomes quite slippery. 
 “The Fremen have a simple, practical religion,"" he said.""Nothing about religion is simple,"" she warned.But Paul, seeing the clouded future that still hung over them, found himself swayed by anger. He could only say: ""Religion unifies our forces. It's our mystique.""""You deliberately cultivate this air, this bravura,"" she charged. ""You never cease indoctrinating.""""Thus you yourself taught me,"" he said.”
Yes, in Dune Frank Herbert hints at the dangers present in such ideas. What seems like your traditional hero’s journey turns out darker and more sinister. But it’s not the rise of an antihero either. It’s subtler than that, without actually being all that subtle. 
“No more terrible disaster could befall your people than for them to fall into the hands of a Hero,"" his father said.
Paul Atreides, in his own words, is “something unexpected.” A son of a planetary Duke (because an interstellar post-technology future is actually feudal) and a highly trained Bene-Gesserit concubine of the Duke (view spoiler)[(basically a member of the order/Sisterhood of superpowered highly trained mind ninjas with strong political worlds-changing ambitions and generations-long breeding experiments aimed at creation of a controllable superhero) (hide spoiler)], Paul fits very well the idea of a Messiah of the tribal resilient society of Fremen people of the harsh desert planet Arrakis, neatly fulfilling their religious prophecies (view spoiler)[(that may have been stealthily planted before by the above-mentioned supernatural ninja order) (hide spoiler)] and possessing genetic superpowers himself, augmented by rigorous training and catalyzed by the ingestion of a magical wonder-drug known as spice. 
“He found that he no longer could hate the Bene Gesserit or the Emperor or even the Harkonnens. They were all caught up in the need of their race to renew its scattered inheritance, to cross and mingle and infuse their bloodlines in a great new pooling of genes. And the race knew only one sure way for this—the ancient way, the tried and certain way that rolled over everything in its path: jihad.”
But Paul through his prescient powers can see what his mythologized destiny leads to. A galactic scale slaughter led by fanatics in his name. And there is not a way to escape it, once your life fits the mysticism of their faith (even if the faith and prophecies were stealthily prereplanted for sort of a similar purpose). Religious fanatics are destined to wage a brutal war that the Messiah is unable to stop. 
“When law and duty are one, united by religion, you never become fully conscious, fully aware of yourself. You are always a little less than an individual.”
With great power comes great responsibility, and all that jazz. But is any of it actually worth it? Wouldn’t the world be better without the burden of Heroes? Are you destined to become exactly what you’re trying to avoid?All this is gently hinted at, laid out in the framework of the appealing Hero’s journey. It seems that should you desire, you can still easily choose to read it as a typical hero’s/antihero’s story, just less idealistic than it could be. But that would be Star Wars and not Dune.
“He was warrior and mystic, ogre and saint, the fox and the innocent, chivalrous, ruthless, less than a god, more than a man. There is no measuring Muad'Dib's motives by ordinary standards. In the moment of his triumph, he saw the death prepared for him, yet he accepted the treachery. Can you say he did this out of a sense of justice? Whose justice, then? Remember, we speak now of the Muad'Dib who ordered battle drums made from his enemies' skins, the Muad'Dib who denied the conventions of his ducal past with a wave of the hand, saying merely: ""I am the Kwisatz Haderach. That is reason enough.” And you also can’t help but be mesmerized by a harsh desiccated planet where life is focused on survival, where not even water but mere moisture is the most coveted and rarest thing, where hopes for a better, wetter, greener future quietly flourish, tied into messianic ideas but grounded in science. The place of nightmares, written vividly and skillfully, making me want to gulp down a gallon of drink just because I can, making me appreciate that my reality doesn’t hinge on surviving on my reclaimed bodily fluids.The world is harsh, unforgiving, brutal, hostile. The characters - well, mostly Paul, but to an extent his mother Jessica as well - are cold, calculating, composed and often very unsympathetic. Paul’s father values lives over property. Paul’s actions, on the other hand, lead to eyebrow-raising among his father’s old lieutenants who note the difference in priorities:
 “Nothing money won't repair, I presume,"" Paul said.""Except for the lives, m'Lord,"" Gurney said, and there was a tone of reproach in his voice as though to say: ""When did an Atreides worry first about things when people were at stake?”
It’s dense and complex, full of politics, short on actual science fiction but full of ruminations on human nature — and it leaves me feeling that all of this is a beginning of another cycle of violence, just with a new figurehead at the mast. As Terry Pratchett said, “But here's some advice, boy. Don't put your trust in revolutions. They always come around again. That's why they're called revolutions.” A new Hero or a new Messiah comes, and begets another cycle or struggle and violence, to be reset anew by a new figurehead sometimes in the future. All while sandworms quietly slither under the sand.—————Oh yeah, there are sandworms, too.—————4 stars out of respect for Herbert’s subversive story that made me think.

Dune,3,"3.5/5 StarsDune oh Dune, seems like I need to raise my Shield Wall for this review.Dune is one of the most important pieces of literature for the Sci-Fi genre. I’ve been raking my brain for hours on how to properly explain the importance of Dune in the sci-fi literature but you know what? I dune (hehehe) think it’s necessary for me to do so. If you truly wanna know why, you can search it on whatever search engine you use and you'll find hundreds of articles or reviews on why this book is that important; and they’ll do a much better job than me. I won’t even deny any of them because, in my opinion, this book was truly revolutionary. Dune didn’t become the number one highest selling Sci-fi novel of all time for no reason; like Brian Herbert said, it is to Sci-Fi, what the LOTR trilogy is to fantasy.Theoretically, if I’m reviewing this by putting my head as someone from 1960’s or 1970’s, I know I would think of this book as my bible. 1965 was the year when Dune was published for the first time, 24 years before I was born. There are just too many groundbreaking ideas, world-building, that would become the inspirations for many Sci-fi in our time; I only realized this after reading this book. I mean, the gigantic Sandworm alone has inspired many video games to use it as a common monster or enemy. Picture: Dune by Marc SimonettiDesert planet, Stillsuits, space exploration, and Zen Buddhism, Dune was truly a groundbreaking novel, almost everything in this book somehow seems prophetic because it has predicted our current society, especially when it comes to faith, emotional control, empathy, and the importance of ecology and scarcity.

“The mind commands the body and it obeys. The mind orders itself and meets resistance.”

Part of what made this book was great for me was Herbert’s prose. I haven’t read enough classic to claim it was classical, but Herbert’s prose was definitely unique to me. It has a lot of freedom by writing it from a limited omniscient narrative; changing POV’s repeatedly in a single chapter without any warning. This is, honestly, one of my biggest pet peeves in my usual read, but Herbert made it work because all his characters were really well written, distinct in their personality, and the dialogues are really well dune (HEHEHE). Plus, there are so many motivational and extremely philosophical quotes that seem to make this book a combination of Sci-Fi & self-help book, such as:

“It is so shocking to find out how many people do not believe that they can learn, and how many more believe learning to be difficult.”

And of course, the most famous and one of the best quote I’ve ever read out of any book

“I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.”

I can’t believe I have gone through life without knowing about this litany against fear. It’s applicable in any kind of hardship we faced in real life, and I know it will be one of my motto starting from now. If I’m judging this book solely from how significant this book was, I’ll give it maximum score in a heartbeat. However, I’m reviewing this based on one question and how I rated all the books I read: was it enjoyable?The answer is yes and no, it was a mixed bag. The first part of this book was incredible, I couldn’t put down the book and everything was so interesting and compelling. Then comes the second part, where the pacing just became really draggy and somehow, boring. However, my hope was restored for a while during the third act, until the anti-climax happened. My expectation is obviously at fault here but hey, this book is the number one highest selling sci-fi book of all time and one of the most highly acclaimed book, I expected there to be a mind-blowing climax sequences to close the book in an epic way. But no, there wasn’t any. Not only it felt anti-climactic, Herbert’s prose in describing settings and actions didn’t age well or up to current standard. The main reason for this is that this is a book that relies heavily on character’s dialogues to do everything; world-building, plot, characterizations were done solely through dialogues. This leads to the great plot but weak action sequences and no vivid settings. Sure there was some explanation on the settings, but other than the planet—which is just a desert, just search Sahara or Planet Tatooine and voila—the interiors were given only brief description, which makes it hard to imagine; I had to look up some artworks to be able to immerse myself in the settings of the book.Overall, Dune was truly a revolutionary book for its time that is filled with tons of imaginative and fantastic ideas. Although there were some parts that disappointed me, I still liked the book and I finally understand why there are so much discussion and praises around this book. I recommend this to every Sci-fi fans for its importance and also, it’s good to know where most fantastic Sci-Fi you’ve read or you’re reading now got its idea from. However, this is also where I’ll stop with the series.You can find this and the rest of my Adult Epic/High Fantasy & Sci-Fi reviews at BookNest"
Dune,5,"I reread Dune for the first time in several decades and immensely enjoyed it. I also went back to watch the feature film and had quite mixed feelings - while it was close to the overall aesthetic that Frank Herbert describes with the gorgeous desert sets and the terrifying worms, the parts of the story that were necessarily culled out was disturbing (that and the woeful special effects at the time trying (and IMHO failing) to visualize the personal shields that the characters wear in hand-to-hand combat). For those who are just discovering Dune for the first time, it is essentially a messianic story on a desert planet (think of Jesus or perhaps Mohammed on Tatooine) in a universe dominated by a cartel (the Guild also known as CHOAM) with a monopoly on a drug (called mélange) derived from a rare material (spice) available only on the desert planet Arrakis (Dune). This drug is so powerful that it allows the Guild (and later Maud'dib) to leverage space-time singularities to defy the speed of light and travel anywhere in the universe. Overlaid on this foundation, the epic battle of the feudal houses of the noble Atreides and the evil Harkkonen houses rages, the betrayal of the former by the latter explicitly endorsed by the Emperor (himself an almost impuissant pawn of the Guild as well). All that to say that the fabric of the story is multilayered and as complex and complete a universe as you will find in George RR Martin or Dan Simmons. There are several enhanced human species running around: the Mentats who have been cerebrally enhanced to be able to calculate like supercomputers and thus give their predictive analytics to their assigned Dukes (or the Emperor) and the Bene Gesserit cult who are a sort of quasi-religious non-celibate nuns who have honed perception and language to the point of having developed nearly superpower-level strengths of persuasion which are almost universally feared and vilified as sorcery in the rest of the universe. Paul Atreides, heir to the throne, is born to Jessica, a Bene Gesserit, possessed some of these powers and when the family moves to Arrakis (part of the aforementioned Harkkonen plot) from their home planet, he appears to the native Freeman population as perhaps a fulfillment of their messianic prophecies and hopes. In perhaps the most critical departure from the book, the movie does not really show Paul questioning the awesome power that he possesses and his assumption of the mantle as the Arrakis Messiah, the Maud'dib. In the book, one aspect that I loved was how Paul struggled with this messianic destiny and did everything he could to subvert it. One of the unique gifts he received, presumably as the rare and unique offspring of a Bene Gesserit, was the ability to see possible outcomes (like a Mentat) and thus he could take decisions based on the most likely foreseen outcome. It made for great reading.The other great thing about Dune is the aesthetic of this desert planet with impossibly huge worms under the surface who are mysteriously connected to spice and pose a danger to all creatures in the desert except for the Freeman. The still suit which recycles body water in the deep desert was brilliant as was the ever-present obsession with ""water debt"" of the Freemen. I really felt like I was walking unevenly (must not attract the worms!) through the sand with Jessica and Paul before their fateful encounter with the Freemen. Dune is a well-deserved classic for all the reasons I mentioned above and probably much more that I missed. I have read it twice and gotten almost entirely different things out of it each time. I have not gone further in the Dune series as most folks told me that the first one was head and shoulders better than the following ones. Let me know in the comments what you liked about Dune and whether you continued to Dune Messiah or not.Fino's Dune ReviewsDuneDune MessiahChildren of DuneGod Emperor of DuneHeretics of DuneChapterhouse: Dune"
Dune,5,"I have to write this review without rhythm so that it won’t attract a worm.In the distant future Arrakis is a hellhole desert planet where anyone who doesn’t die of thirst will probably be eaten by one of the giant sandworms. It’s also the only place where the precious spice melange can be found so it’s incredibly valuable, and the honorable Duke Leto Atreides has been ordered by the Padishah Emperor to take over control of Arrakis from his mortal enemies, the House Harkonnen. While this seems like a great offer on the surface the Duke and his people realize that it’s actually a cunning trap being set by the Emperor and Baron Harkonnen. The only hope seems to be allying with the local populace called Fremen whose harsh environment has led them to become an incredibly tough and disciplined people, but they have their own vision of what Arrakis should be. They also have a prophecy about the coming of a messiah figure who will lead them to freedom, and the Duke’s son Paul looks like he may be exactly who they’ve been waiting for.This is classic sci-fi that really deserves the label. What Frank Herbert accomplished in one novel is stunning because he built a fascinatingly detailed universe in which the politics, religion, economics, espionage, and military strategy are all equally important. He then blended these more grounded concepts with bigger sci-fi ideas like being able to use spice to see through space-time, and the scope of that encompasses trying to pick the proper path through various potential timelines as well as free will vs. fate. I think one of the factors that helps this story stay timeless is that so much of it is based on what humanity becomes vs. trying to predict what futuristic technology would be like. This is a society that once had a war with machines and has since rejected any type of computers so people have developed to fill the gap with the help of the spice. The Mentats are trained to use data to predict outcomes. The Navigators of the Guild have used so much of the spice to help them move through space that they’re mutating. The all female Bene Gesserit have developed a variety of skills to place their members alongside positions of power to help advance their breeding scheme that spans generations. Herbert also cleverly came up with an excuse that explains why knives and hand-to-hand combat are so important with the idea of the personal body shields. So even though we still got a good sci-fi’s novel worth of cool gadgets the emphasis is on what the people can do and how that’s developed over a long period of time. It also adds a lot of depth to the political dimensions because all of these groups have different agendas that cause them all to mistrust each other, but because they all fill these various roles none can exist without the others.There are also parallels to our world that are still in play because the idea of a desert people caught up in the power struggles of various outsiders because of their valuable natural resource is an obvious allegory to the Middle East that still works today. Plus, the classic film Lawrence of Arabia came out a few years before Herbert published this, and you have to think that it had some influence on him because there are elements of the story that seem very much inspired by it.While the whole concept of a Chosen One has gotten a bit worn over time that’s not Herbert’s fault, and this is still a fantastic sci-fi story with big ideas that also works as space opera as well as being an epic adventure story."
Dune,5,"Dune (Dune Chronicles #1), Frank HerbertDune is a 1965 science fiction novel by American author Frank Herbert. In the far future, humanity has eschewed advanced computers due to a religious prohibition, in favor of adapting their minds to be capable of extremely complex tasks. Much of this is enabled by the spice melange, which is found only on Arrakis, a desert planet with giant sand-worms as its most notable native life-form.Melange improves general health, extends life and can bestow limited prescience, and its rarity makes it a form of currency in the interstellar empire. Melange allows the Spacing Guild's Navigators to safely route faster-than-light travel between planets, and helps the Reverend Mothers of the matriarchal Bene Gesserit to access their Other Memory, the ego and experiences of their female ancestors.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز بیست و چهارم ماه نوامبر سال 2018میلادیعنوان: تلماسه؛ نویسنده: فرانک هربرت؛ مترجم: مهیار فروتن فر؛ تهران، کتابسرای تندیس؛ 1397؛ در 847ص؛ فروست شاهکارهای علمی تخیلی؛ شابک 9786001822834؛ موضوع داستانهای نویسندگان امریکایی - سده 20مداستان «تل‌ماسه» در آینده‌ ای دور می‌گذرد، و در جامعه‌ ای ملوک الطوایفی، کتاب با الهام از جوامع اعراب بدوی، نگاشته شده‌ است؛ سه عامل اثرگذار در جامعه ای فراسیاره‌ ای: پادشاه امپراتور و خاندان‌های حکومتی، اتحادیه ی فضایی (صاحب انحصار حمل و نقل فضایی)، و گروه بنی جزریت، هستند؛ در جهانی سوار بر همان سه‌ پایه‌ ی: «سلطه‌ جویی»، «سیاست‌بازی» و «سوداگری»، و گردنده بر چرخِ آدم‌کشانِ رایانه‌ سان، ساحرانِ نژادپرور، و ناوبرانِ زمان‌ نورد، «پُل»، دوک‌ زاده‌ ی جوان خاندان «آتریدیز» است، که خود را گرفتار در طوفانی عالم‌ آشوب می‌یابد؛ نزاعی کیهانی بر سر کیمیای زمانه است، در آوردگاهی یگانه، سرچشمه‌ ی کیمیا در سرتاسر کائنات: تلماسه است، کره‌ ای از شن سوزان، که دغدغه‌ ی بومیانش نه «ملغما (کیمیای زمانه)»، که بقاست؛نقل از متن (کتاب اول: تلماسه: سرآغاز هر کار زمان حصول اطمینان از درستی میزانها و معیارهاست؛ حتی مبتدی ترین شاگردان مکتب «بنه جسریت» هم این نکته را میدانند؛ پس فراموش نکنید که در شروع مطالعه ی زندگانی مودِّب او را در زمان حیاتش که از پنجاه و هفتمین سال سلطنت امپراتورْ پاشا شدامِ چهارم آغاز شد و در محل زندگی اش یعنی سیاره ی آراکیس در نظر آورید؛ اجازه ندهید این حقیقت که زادگاه او کالادان بوده و پانزده سال آغازین عمرش را در آنجا گذرانده گمراهتان کند؛ آراکیس، سیاره ای که آن را به نام تلماسه میشناسند، جایگاه او بوده و تا ابد خواهد بود؛ ـ برگرفته از کتاب راهنمای مودِب، نوشته ی شاهدخت «آیرولان») یک هفته پیش از مهاجرت خاندان «آتریدیز» به «آراکیس»، در میان دوندگیهای لحظه ی آخر که دیگر داشت به جنونی افسار گسیخته و تحمل ناپذیر بدل میشد، عجوزه ای به دیدار مادرِ پُل آمد کاخ «کالادان» شب نسبتاً گرمی را میگذراند و مانند تمام اوقات پیش از بارندگی، روی تخته سنگهای برهم چیده ی کهنسالی که برای بیست و شش نسل از خاندان «آتریدیز» حکم خانه را داشتند، نم سردی نشسته بود عجوزه از درِ جانبی وارد عمارت شد، و با عبور از راهرویی طاقدار به اتاق پل رسید؛ در آنجا لحظه ای درنگ کرد، و به داخل سرک کشید تا نگاهی به «پل» بیندازد که در تختخوابش آرمیده بود پسرک که حالا بیدار شده بود، در کورسوی چراغ معلقی که نزدیک به زمین شناور بود، پیکر تنومند زنی را میدید که در درگاه اتاقش، یک قدم جلوتر از مادرش ایستاده بود؛ چهره ی سایه وش پیرزن به جادوگران میمانست: موهای درهم تنیده اش به تارعنکبوت ماننده بود، و چشمانش، در تاریکی باشلقی که بر سر کشیده بود، به دو تکه جواهر براق پیرزن گفت: «سنش کمتر از چیزی که هست به نظر میآید، نه جسیکا؟» صدایش تودماغی بود و مانند بالیستِ کوک نشده وزوز میکرد؛ مادرِ «پل» با صدایی ملایم و بم پاسخ داد: «در خاندان آتریدیز رشد دیررس معمول است، حضرت والا.»؛ پیرزن وزوزکنان گفت: «بله شنیده ام، شنیده ام. با این حال...؛ جداً پانزده سالش شده؟»؛ «بله، حضرت والا.»؛ پیرزن گفت: «بیدار است؛ دارد به حرفهایمان گوش میدهد»؛ نیشخندی زد و ادامه داد: «شیطانک مکار! البته بد نیست...؛ کمی مکر و حیله برای اشرافزادگان واجب است...؛ و اگر او واقعاً کویساتز هدراخ باشد...؛ خوب...»؛ پل چشمانش را در پناه سایه های تختخواب به اندازه ی دو شیار باریک باز کرد و به نظرش آمد که چشمان بیضی شکل براق و پرنده سانِ پیرزن نیز در پاسخْ بازتر و درخشانتر شد)؛ پایان نقلتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 23/09/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی"
Dune,3,"Upon reread... still 3.5 stars. I loved it in concept and discussion, but the writing style just kills it for me. I have such mixed feelings about this book. Video review https://youtu.be/tqvIwpjumkM3.5 starsI'm really bummed that this wasn't a book I enjoyed more. I think the story itself was brilliant. The entire concept and and plot were incredible and I had such an odd experience of appreciating the story - yet not actually enjoying reading it. The narration was just so unengaging to me that I never felt immersed in the story or connected to the characters. I get why this is so well loved and maybe in the future I can reread it and be able to enjoy it more <3"
Dune,5,"I’ve been sitting at this keyboard for longer than I care to admit trying to coalesce my thoughts about Dune into something coherent. You already know it’s fantastic though, right? Dune is one of those novels that is spoken of in reverential tones by seasoned reader and relative newbie alike. It’s considered by many to be THE best sci-fi novel of all time and Herbert’s son, Brian Herbert, rightfully calls it sci-fi’s equivalent to Lord of the Rings for inspiring all that came after its publication. So, I mean, what in the name of Shai-Hulud am I supposed to add to that?Well, I’ll begin with the story of how I came to read Dune. I’m sure that there have been ample opportunities to read the book. I can remember seeing the black-spine amidst a forest of other spines on my cousin’s bookshelf, of which I had free reign. Yet something always kept me from picking it up. It could have been my obsession with fantasy novels at that time with only the briefest allowances for sci-fi. Whatever the reason, the book continued to pop up. Its sliver of desert on a black background called to me from piles at used bookstores, the shelves of friends and relatives, and even on public transportation. All the same, I never got around to it.Two factors finally made the difference. The first, my well-read friend (Josh Bragg in real life, but he’s on Goodreads too!) always brought it up as one of the best books he’s ever read. He also took the opportunity to remind me to read it whenever book recommendations went flying between us and, foolishly, I kept putting him off. But I’m a sucker for a great looking book and these Penguin Galaxy sci-fi collections sealed the deal for me. Their elegant cover designs, the intros by Neil Gaiman, a selection of books I’d always been meaning to read, AND Dune was on it? I was absolutely delighted to find the book under the tree on Christmas morning and tore into it in earnest. THE TIME HAD FINALLY COMEThough it took near 200 pages to really pick up speed, the novel had me hooked from its immersive opening. Here was a world that was familiar and strange at the same time. There are elements of fantasy and religion coupled with interplanetary travel and space empires. The characters touted titles that were inscrutable at the beginning, but became part of my vocabulary before the novel’s end. The novel refused to tell me everything I needed to understand, secreting mysteries without ever outright stating them. How could I not want to know what Kwisatz Haderach meant? How could I not want to know the secrets of Arrakis? The Layers of DuneI was swept away by this novel that mixes sci-fi concepts of higher dimensions with political intrigue. Environmental change mixed with an unlimited cast of enthralling characters, and a drop of religious philosophy. Dune is a novel of the highest order: it combines entertainment with brilliant questions that pull from an incredible number of disciplines. Of course, if you just want to read a compelling tale of political plotting, murder, adventure, and discovery, you can totally do that too.In the afterword, Brian Herbert notes a conversation he had with his father about the writing and structure of Dune. Frank Herbert constructed Dune so that it would be immensely dense. Herbert wanted to create a tale that could be enjoyed on the level of the central conflict: a boy becoming a man trying to reclaim his heritage against astounding odds in a world beyond imagining. Here’s an excerpt from that afterword about the layers.Ecology is the most obvious layer, but alongside that are politics, religion, philosophy, history, human evolution, and even poetry. (Page 693 of the Penguin Galaxy Edition) The fact that the novel can be enjoyed from any number of different readings alone makes it a novel of huge significance. Dune doesn’t force you into thinking, but it invites the interested to partake in its rich metaphor and multifaceted meaning. What’s more, Herbert makes statements about his concepts, but rarely does he offer them as the only solution (barring, perhaps, an ecological viewpoint that bemoans industrialization). I dove into different fields of thought between and during readings. I contemplated elegant ideas Herbert proposes and marveled at the structure of the plot and the boundless ideas of this world.What a world it is! The world building here could fill a university course as Herbert establishes a world unlike any other, but totally believable. When I read about the stillsuit I was astonished by its creativity, but also how it imparted valuable information about the world of Arrakis. Though the sandworms scream for attention throughout the novel, equal care is given to the hierarchy of the Empire, the mystical Bene Gesserit religion, and the curiosities of culture. Herbert also seems to have invented a group of hallucinogenic compounds that are in equal parts trippy, interesting, and betray an interesting look at 1960s culture.Dune drew me in and took me for a ride that I never wanted to get off.Of course, when the ride does end, it is immensely satisfying. Dune ends leaving unanswered questions in a fashion that made me feel like I knew enough to be entirely contented. Which, of course, begs the question: will I read the other Dune novels? Welllllllllllllllll, maybe. It’s highly daunting to look at the entire Dune Chronicles and think that I would tackle that. Especially when Dune ends in a way that makes me so happy, and especially when the subsequent novels purportedly deliver diminishing returns. For now, I’m too overjoyed and impressed by Dune to consider returning to the world anytime soon other than to re-read the novel.Obviously, I can’t recommend Dune enough. That’s also not a recommendation that goes to the sci-fi crowd alone. Oh no, this is a book that has great appeal to a wide variety of people. You like A Song of Ice and Fire? Perfect: you’ll love the backstabbing, the plots-within-plots, the combat, the story. You don’t read sci-fi? No worries: there’s a wealth of important themes upon which to reflect. You like sci-fi, your friends continuously recommend you read Dune, and you keep putting it off?Goodreadians, I think you know what you need to do!"
Dune,5,"Like most of my five star books, I’ve read Dune multiple times. In fact, I’d say that what makes a book more than just enjoyable and instead truly amazing is that you want to read it more than once and are rewarded for doing so. I’ve probably read Dune six times, and I’ve never gotten tired of it but my understanding of the work has increased over time.To begin with, the first time I read Dune, I got about three pages into it, realized I didn’t understand a thing and that I was hopelessly confused. I had to go back and reread what I had read, and then go back again and reread the whole chapter. I would excuse myself by saying that I was 10, but I’m sure I’m not the only one that has had that experience. Don’t be dismayed if it happens to you - whether 10, 18, or 45. If you are confused at first, consider that Paul is also confused and finds so much that happens strange and new. Understanding will come in its proper time.At one time at least, there was a fairly famous website (at least among geeks) that humorously summarized books in thirty words or less. Maybe it still exists, but its name escapes me. The summary provided for Dune read something like this, “I’m Frank Herbert and I’m a lot smarter than you are.” When I was younger, this would have seemed a fair appraisal of the work. One of the most central aspects of ‘Dune’ is Herbert manages to write convincingly about people whose intelligence is supposed to vastly exceed that of the reader. More than anything, to create a believable Messianic story, the writer has to create a Messiah possessing believable Messianic wisdom and insight, and Herbert succeeds at this invention probably better than any other writer. We come to believe that the protagonists do have deep and profound insight into the question of ‘Life, the Universe, and Everything’ so that we do not immediately feel cheated and we are able to believe in the characters – even someone like Maud’Dib. As I’ve gotten older, and hopefully wiser, I’ve come to see that Herbert is not in fact possessed of superhuman intelligence, but that he creates the illusion of superhuman intelligence by a variety of clever devices. The appearance of a superhuman intelligence and wisdom is really a sham and the pool is really pretty shallow, but even this revelation does not reduce the esteem in which I hold the work. It’s not Herbert’s real job to be a prophet: he’s an artist. Herbert succeeds brilliantly in what he should be judged on – the ability to paint the illusion deftly and convincingly. If we acquire the sophistication to see through it, it shouldn’t reduce our appreciation of the artistic mastery used in creating it. I think now I would amend the summary of the work to be, “I’m Frank Herbert, and I’m a lot better writer than you are.”If all that could be said in Dune’s favor was that it had one of the most convincing invented prophets in literature, it would still be a worthwhile work. But Dune has abundant pleasures beyond the richly realized illusion of philosophical depth and even the deftly realized setting. Chief among these for me is the truly deep and intricate relationships Paul has with the other characters. There is a real depth of feeling here, and I love the way each of the complicated nuanced relationships is portrayed as we are introduced to the cast of Paul’s complicated life. Each character feels a deep mixture of feelings for Paul who is boy, man, friend, soldier, sovereign, and Messiah and much else. There is tenderness to this work. We sense that complexity and tenderness right from the start, when his mother allows him to be tortured and to face murder, and then immediately thereafter experiences profound hope and joy: “My son lives.” We feel Paul’s boyish love for his friends and companions, who are also his father’s henchmen and his teachers and who he is in turn their future Lord. We feel the more mature manly love that these companions have for their young charge and future ruler. Even Yueh loves the boy he must destroy. We feel the boyish admiration Paul has for his father as he strains to be worthy of him and to make his father proud, and we feel the returned pride and satisfaction that his father feels. We feel the aching love of a boy for this Mother when he has already lost everything else when Jessica is buried in sand, and we feel her returned love when she says, “I knew you would find me.”And though there love is only briefly on stage, still I find the love between Paul and Chani among the sweetest and most charming in literature. Who cannot thrill when scarcely knowing each other, but seeing their lives together stretching out before them both good and terrible, the young becoming but not yet lovers promise with tender vows nonetheless to be forever each other's comfort and joy and they feel their hitherto unseen future becoming a real solid now. Isn’t that how it is in some way for all of us when we meet the one who will be the one and we suddenly realize we want to and we will spend the rest of our lives together regardless of what will happen? And how often have we felt the total unabashed joy as Paul does when we know our lover is now near?“That could only mean Chani was near by—Chani, his soul, Chani his sihaya, sweet as the desert spring, Chani up from the palmaries of the deep south.”All that and ‘Dune’ is a wonderful exciting action adventure story filled with thrills and chases, fights and battles, and supersized edge of our imagination wonders. Worms.It’s no wonder that this is one of the best beloved books of all time. If you haven’t read it, you should. If you have read it, read it again."
Dune,4,"Like medieval (but the Islamic enlightenment version of it) times, a caste system and the oil industry imposed upon space opera, with mystical elements permeating the whole and simultaneously telling the rise of a Napoleon like hero. Dune sounds like a book that shouldn’t work, but does, in an unique, complex and compelling manner.The person who experiences greatness must have a feeling for the myth he is in. He must reflect what is projected upon him.Start of the legendI must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.The last 25% of the book was a wild ride that really upped my enjoyment of this reread, and left me impressed with the worldbuilding and boldness of Frank Herbert.But to start: Dune is a classic in the scifi field, but is quite atypical. Technological progress has stalled after a jihad against thinking machines (aka computers) and a kind of medieval society in space has emerged. An emperor reigns, planets are dished out as fiefs and mysterious sects (We Bene Gesserit sift people to find the humans.) follow their own paths to influence events. Some kind of social darwinism is at play, and the conviction that humanity can be massively better (or worse) is we return our attention to oneself instead of towards technology.The terms are at the start quite hard to get into, even though I know the story and remember some of them from last time reading the book. Arrakis, the Dune from the title, is an other interesting thing. This desert planet is almost a separate character (The highest function of ecology is understanding consequences), being handed to the Atreides duke and worsening a blood feud with the Harkonnens, the previous owners of the planet.It is interesting how Herbert decided to reveal the first murder plot perpetrator quite soon, showing evidently that this is a book more about ideas then tension.In general the book is biblical in language and the weight assigned to events, with foreshadowing and myths. The world feels rich and alive.The main character is Paul Atreides, the son of duke Leto. He is groomed to take on his role of leader of a major house, and by his Bene Gesserit mother Jessica (who is, for lack of a better analogy, a kind of crossing between a martial arts expert, nun and witch). There are several other retainers, who are depicted in a manner that I can only compare to The Lord of the Rings.The characters in general feel greater than life, for instance the level of perception and deduction at the dinner party is superhuman, I can only imagine because there is no advanced technology that the psychic training must somehow become more advanced and leads to the kind of casual analysis Jessica and Paul are capable of.The fall of house Atreides is still a brutal event, even if you know it is coming and feels swift and unexpected, as does Paul’s enlightenment.Predetermination versus free willA kind of Heisenberg indeterminacy intervened: the expenditure of energy that revealed what he saw, changed what he saw.To be fair, halfway in the book I felt a kind of lull in reading. The main characters are thrown back upon themselves and need to establish themself amongst the Freemen, Bedouin like desert folk who are much more powerful than thought.In these sections there is such a sensitivity to culture and worldbuilding, Tatooine or the Aiel of Robert Jordan are nothing compared to the depth Herbert manages to bring go Arrakis and its Freemen. So much must have been thought of but has been left out, given a richness in the world conjured that is only rivaled by Middle Earth.The scenes are intense, and well written, but in way a bit dull since the ascent of Paul to power seems assured. There is banter that is really sharp, like:“Do you trust me?”“I hear your sincerity.”And Paul is shown as doubting, self aware of his rise and what it entails, commenting on heroism and mythmaking, and the restraints to his powers: (The vision made him want to freeze into immobility, but this, too, was action with its consequences.)But the third part, especially to the end, shows real boldness by skipping two years and taking on tragic events (Grief is the price of victory), sometimes only in an indirect manner.Alia is a good example, and all the implications and struggles, guilt, she must bring with her. You feel it, it is touched upon, but never in an on the nose manner.And the development of the relationship between Stilgar and Paul also carries sadness and an awareness of the corrosive power of adoration and myth: I have seen a friend become a worshipper.The epicness of both the story and main character Paul (and a shoutout to Chani and Jessica as well) is just beyond anything. For instance somewhere near the end Paul responds the following to a warning that the galactic emperor is coming down upon him in force:""When the Emperor learns that he’ll not rest until he has you over a slow fire.""""The Emperor’s not likely to have that power over me.""Decadence as an indication of ineffectiveness and decline, while orthodoxy, returning to the core of human struggle for life, is a way out of the impasse, comes back as a theme.The actual enlightenment and power of Paul as gained by the spice is unknowable to a reader, since he operates on another level entirely. Time being a dimension, Paul transcends the three dimensions and becomes something inhuman along the way, a singularity like the technical singularity.Some minor criticism ""How could you do such a foolish thing?"" she demanded.""He is your son""Oké, what is this convenient weirding suddenly along the way?Why is count Fenring there, what does he add in anyway to the story?And how the hell does Paul get nuclear weapons all of the sudden.And as said: the second part of the book really did not speak that much to me.But in no way it can be denied that the world conjured by Dune is rich, bold and interesting, and that I very much look forward to see the movie in 2021!Bad ass quotes:She said that the mystery of life isn’t a problem to solve, but a reality to experience....and the mystery of life is not a problem to solve but a reality to experience.The concept of progress acts as a protective mechanism to shield us from the terrors of the future.But the test of a man isn’t what you think he’ll do. It’s what he actually does.The people who can destroy a thing, they control it.The power to destroy a thing is the absolute control over it."
Dune,5,"This science fiction book was scary. The story set very far into the future has no prudence in it. This is a possible scenario. When I read this book, I was affected by this dark and dismal future.Sure, the book is sometimes like an adventure. But a lot of it has to do with politics. There is a struggle to control the only planet (Arrakis) which has the spice melange in it. The French noun mélange means mixture. Melange practically makes a superhuman out of a mere man.I was drawn into the story from early on. Sometimes one can know that the entire book one is reading is bad or not. Dune is like the lightning captured in a bottle. Books like this happen once in a generation. A 5 star book once again. Fully deserved."
Dune,3,"Welcome to Unpopular Review Time! Where I go against what almost everyone else says about a book.Before we start, please do not be fooled by the three star rating. Even if I didn't like really like the book, I have to acknowledge there are reasons why Dune is a cornerstone of the Sci Fi genre. Now, let's talk about the important stuff.This is a masterpiece of world building.We get a new planet, and while it's obvious that Herbert based his desert planet on real sights and cultures, it's still awesome. The Fremen and their culture, the stillsuits, the worms, the plight for water... It's all explained in such a vivid detail without being boring or repetitive. And while reading you can see the references! Can we talk about how many movies and books have been influenced by this?We also get a future Empire where machines are no longer used for computation purposes. Instead, humans have been trained to unlock their full brain potential and make such calculations. And we get two schools of these ""enhanced"" humans: the Bene Gesserit and the Mentats. And we get lots of details explaining this new society: the Empire, the Noble Houses, the Guild, how each group interacts with the others, the intrigue surrounding all dealings... The plot is straightforward and follows a 'Chosen One' pattern. Paul, is the 'Chosen One', the Lisan al-Gaib, the Kwisatz Haderach. He gets many names. After a betrayal, he finds refuge among the Fremen and seeks revenge from those who wronged his house. Here comes my first problem with the book, you can divide it in a before and after around the betrayal point. (I'm not spoiling anything by telling you this, believe me, the book will tell you ALL about it) Before this the plot drags along at a slow and unpleasant pace (at least for me.) The story is told in a third person omniscient point of view, and the author uses this liberally, giving us a peek into the different characters' thoughts. And he loves repeating ideas. So we get to know about the betrayal from the bad guy who planned it, from the traitor himself, from everyone inside House Atreides who knows that there's a traitor and suspects everyone,... and all this before anything actually happens! When the scene finally rolls in I was so tired of the plot I almost gave up on the book.After this the plot actually picks up and there's lots of action. However I had some more problems with it, as I'll explain ahead.While they were all artfully created and developed; there's no way to connect with any of these characters.The way Herbert planned his 'Chosen One' and his society, most of the characters are deeply logical and, dare I say, stuffy? They think and re-think, and plan and plot, and think again, computing everything with a very small dose of humanity. (Ha! And they call themselves humans.) Paul is wise beyond his years, not only by his training, but by his evolution during the story. It made me think of another chosen child: Harry Potter, but where we all wanted to be Harry, or at least one of his friends; I really had no thought of befriending this one. (I did pity him a lot.)And then there's the bad guy! Oh Gods. I've never in my life seen such a TERRIBLE antagonist and I don't say this lightly. He's a fat ugly guy, who cannot even move himself. He's a pedophile, a slave worker, treats everyone horribly including his own family. There is absolutely no redeeming quality to this guy. He's almost cartoonish in how bad he is. And I never ever got his hate for the Atreides, I can understand greed, personal vendettas, house wars. But his hate seemed too personal and at the same time too huge to be understandable. Also, he was the typical movie villain that loved to rehash his plots over and over again, and brag about how cunning he was. Complete freaking waste of time.Last, but not least. The ending is incredibly abrupt and I DID NOT like it. Call me romantic, call me naive, call me soft. I don't care. I thought that last paragraph was the wrong thing to say. All in all this was a great book, but it wasn't my cup of tea. I suggest you read it. If only so you can see Star Wars in a pretty different light. ---Image Credits'The Defeat of the Sarduakar' by John Schoenherr.""Fremen of Dune"" by Sammy Hall ""Vladimir Harkonnen"" by a-hour"
Dune,3,"Epic and highly inventive, but not nearly as great as I remember it being. I think Herbert's writing really gets in the way of the story. He continuously tells the reader what each character is thinking through italicized internal dialogue. Sometimes uses the third person narration to do the same thing in a more elegant way. The problem is that he does both, often times for the same character in the same paragraph. It's super clunky, and took me out of the story every time."
Dune,5,"Mostly riveting! In general, I think I loved it?The worldbuilding is still legendary here, all these years later. I'm going to leave the issues alone (Obviously, there are issues. 1965 was a long time ago).Mostly, I can see why this book is a beloved classic and why it's been so inspirational. It's a wild ride, interweaving a lot of cool threads, with so much to say about so many dimensions of human life in the possible future. Really cool overall. And the worms are awesome."
Dune,5,"Buddy re-read with Athena!“To begin your study of the life of Muad'Dib, then, take care that you first place him in his time: born in the 57th year of the Padishah Emperor, Shaddam IV. And take the most special care that you locate Muad'Dib in his place: the planet Arrakis. Do not be deceived by the fact that he was born on Caladan and lived his first fifteen years there. Arrakis, the planet known as Dune, is forever his place.”Thus begins one of the greatest novels ever written.About ten years ago, when I was ten or eleven years old, I took my first cautious steps away from children’s and young adult books and into the wonderful world of adult literature. I remember that there were especially two grand works of fiction that shaped this period of my life, and eventually managed to change it forever. The first was a huge brick of a fantasy novel whose name was The Lord of the Rings. The second was a rather small, blue book with a particularly interesting cover, which I discovered in one of my father’s bookshelves. Its name was Dune.And that was how I first came along on the adventures of Paul-Muad’Dib on the endless sands of Arrakis. I met people like the warmaster Gurney Halleck and the swordmaster Duncan Idaho, the aging assassin Thufir Hawat, the wise and powerful Lady Jessica of the Bene Gesserit, the disgustingly evil Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, and the stunningly beautiful Princess Irulan. I encountered the greatest of the sandworms in the deep desert, and I witnessed Muad’Dib as he lived amongst the mysterious blue-eyed Fremen and as he struggled and fought against those who betrayed his family.Now, ten years later, I have read the book once more. And to my great satisfaction I discovered that it had lost none of the magic that worked so well on me the first time. The political machinations of the Great Houses and the Imperium were still as interesting and exciting as the first time. The sandworms were still as awe-inspiring as when I last read about them. And even though the book could not possibly have the same effect on me today as it had on that little boy ten years ago, it was still an amazingly enjoyable book from the first page until the very end. There was more than a fair bit of nostalgia involved when it came to settling on a final rating, and I find it likely that the rating would have been lower if I were reading this for the first time. Still, I would argue that Dune is not only one of my personal favourites, but one of the absolute best examples of fictional literature ever. It has become a pillar on which dozens of later works now stand, from Star Wars to the Wheel of Time. What is it that makes this book so great? My answer would be neither the story nor the characters, even though both of those are great. No, the most extraordinary aspect about this book is most certainly its setting. In contrast to a great majority of science fiction, this novel takes place almost exclusively on one single planet. Arrakis. Dune. Desert planet. This is the world that inspired Tatooine. This is the world on which House Atreides fights for its survival in the heart of a treacherous universe. And, last but not least, this is the world where the sandworms roam. The world of the shai-hulud.
”History is written on the sands of Arrakis.""
"
Dune,4,"Dune is often said to be one of the classic masterpieces of 20th century American science fiction. Incidentally, it probably owes its reputation to the film adaptation David Lynch directed in the early 1980s (this movie was, and still is, not considered one of his best, however). Indeed, Frank Herbert wrote a novel of epic proportions, in other words, a space opera, with its intergalactic feudal society, its decadent (if not evil) empire and its band of rebels: the book was published some ten years before the first instalment of the Star Wars series. It was, with Asimov's Foundation, one of Lucas’ primary source of inspiration.One of the most exciting aspects of Herbert’s creation is the multi-cultural world he depicts. Each house (Atreides, Harkonnen, etc.), each planet (Arrakis, Giedi Prime, Caladan...), each group (the Fremen, the Bene Gesserit, the Guild, the Emperor’s suite and the Sardaukars) has its specific flavour, its own culture, its language, and one of the fascinating parts of this novel is probably the index at the end. For each of these cultures, Herbert has borrowed traits from the ones (ancient or contemporary) he knew well in reality, more specifically the Muslim culture. In this way, Paul Atreides / Muad’Dib’s story among the Fremen made me think of T.E. Lawrence and the Arab revolt against the Ottoman Empire. In fact, the story of Paul on Arrakis is told as if it were ancient history or even a legend, through the bits of chronicles “by the Princess Irulan” that open each chapter.Herbert takes care to describe his fictional world and the character’s actions in great detail, but I found these descriptions somewhat boring and, especially, the middle of the book is a bit dragging for that reason. In my view, however, the most impressive aspect of this novel is the dialogues (and there are many!), where Herbert consistently reveals what the persons are thinking inwardly at the same time as what they are saying. The result is a sense of duplicity and scheming in almost every interaction between characters. Each of them is always plotting one way or another, so that the whole thing ends up being like a great Shakespearean play, with dialogues and asides, tyrants and pretenders. What confirms this impression is not only the theme of the exiled Duke (see: As You Like It for instance, or even King Lear), but also the repeated scenes of fencing duels throughout, with feints and poisoned tips: a clear remembrance of the final scenes in Hamlet and Macbeth, to name only the Bard’s most popular plays."
Dune,4,"Rating: 4* of fiveUPDATE 5/18/2019 The 1984 film is free with Prime on Amazon. With a new version being filmed right now and including some serious firepower from Director Denis Villeneuve to Timothee Chalamet as Muad'dib the Kwisatz Haderach, it seemed like a good moment for a rewatch. It truly is a gorgeous film, but really not so hot on the woke front. Surprise surprise surprise says my brain in its full Gomer Pyle mode.2/15/17: I found this 2003 mini-documentary about the 1984 film on YouTube. I wasn't wrong. The film wasn't very good. Beautiful, yes; good, not so much.***I first read this novel in 1975. It seems impossible that it was over 40 years ago, but the math is inescapable and time inexorable. My teenaged brain was rewired by the read. I had a standard by which to judge all future SFnal reads, and it was a high one. I was transported into a future I was utterly convinced would be the the one I'd have descendants to live in. I suppose that could yet happen. I'm a lot less convinced now that the human race's future is that long. Age might bring wisdom, I wouldn't know about that, but it sure brought me a booster shot of cynicism.The Orange Catholic Bible, the books of the Empress Irulan, they all seemed to me so real...the cry ""never to forgive, never to forget"" rings louder today than it did in 1975 because I've lived through so many iterations of it by now. Us people, we love the shit out of our vicious vengeful vendettas, don't we. Frank Herbert got that right as all hell.Trouble is, ol' Frank wasn't any kind of a writer, was he? He had flashes of good phrasemaking, he had long stretches of competent prosemongering, and then there was the rest of the ninety jillion words in the novel. Serviceable is le mot juste. And TBH I feel pretty generous putting it that way.But then came David Lynch. Oh dear, oh dear. I'm not a worshipper of Lynch's at the best of times. I thought Blue Velvet was brummagem and boring; Twin Peaks was portentous twaddle. So the Kool-Aid passed my seat, I fear. His 1984 adaptation of Dune was downright laughable. I left the theater torn between gales of laughter and gusts of grief-stricken tears. Sting in that stupid winged underwear! KYLE MacLACHLAN as Paul Atreides!! Ludicrous, all of it, and the problems started with the butchery of so much of the novel that even the bones were scattered in no sensible pattern. Inevitable, really, as the runtime of the film was a paltry two hours and seventeen minutes. Imagine trying to wedge a 600-page magnum opus dense with world-building and replete with internal ironies and levels of meaning into the length of a good winter's nap. Didn't work so good.SciFi Channel, gods please bless their collective hides, approved a mini-series written and directed by John Harrison in 2000. It was 4:17:07 in total. That was *almost* enough to do justice to the story. The result was infinitely superior to the Lynch version. It was a joy to watch for me, a forty-year-old cruelly wounded mess of a man, and felt like a balm to my fanboy memory of the novel. Perfect? No. Great? Yep!Then I found it on YouTube (of course it's since been deleted) and thought I'd take a respite from reality by giving it a rewatch. You know what? Special effects age badly. Mid-budget TV ones age really, really, really badly. The screenplay clunked a good deal. The story, however, was all there and was well done, with the prunings and bonsai sculptings well chosen and well shaped. And the story was just about as timely as anything I could've hoped to avoid!Dune bashed me upside the temples with its portrayal of the collapse of Empire and revolution of the have-nots in a way it couldn't have 17 or 42 years ago. It felt more timely, it packed more wallop than it possibly could have in fatter times. This is my idea of good myth-making: A story that isn't finished telling us the truth yet, and doing so in a way that compels, impels, propels us to go on the journey ready or not. The idea of a Savior come to rescue us is eternally appealing, the sight of the unworthy getting their comeuppance is evergreen. It wasn't what I was seeking, wasn't escapist boom-bang-blowwie, but it was what I needed. A bit of heartening to fight again, odds be buggered.And now I'm told that there's a new version on the way, possibly to be directed by Denis Villeneuve of Arrival fame. That's some fire-power there. A director with clout and access to Hollywood's cash box could do something special with this epic...though I'm still very concerned with the issues inevitable in adapting the story to movie length. Isn't it interesting how every decade seems to call for a new version of the story? The 1960s had the novel; the 1970s the unmade Alejandro Jodorowsky adaptation, a perfect reflection of the decade's malaise/limitation mentality; the 1980s cheesy, overblown one-note-and-it's-the-wrong-one ethos; the 1990s void, again perfectly in keeping with the culture; the 2000s TV version, as everything shrunk in the aftermath of the floodwaters of Bush's election stealing; and now a big-budget, major-talent remake! That hasn't happened yet! And bids fair not to, in the parlous economic times ahead!Frank Herbert's Dune is a great rewatch. The novel hasn't finished with us yet. I hope it won't any time soon."
Dune,4,"This is a classic science fiction book with both movies and miniseries adaptations, so I assume the majority of the people are familiar with the plot which means I will be a little less careful about giving spoilers than usual.In the distant future the humanity is ruled by an intergalactic feudal Empire - is absolute monarchy the best the humanity could come up with after all its history? Anyway, Duke Leto Atreides accepts control of a desert planet called Arrakis (aka Dune) which also happened to be the only source of some substance called spice which importance is slowly revealed in the course of the book. By the way the reasons for this duty and its acceptance are at best murky to begin with and they are never explained and become even more unclear down the road.Dune used to be a stronghold and the major source of wealth of Duke's sworn enemy Baron Vladimir Harkonnen who actually somehow managed to arrange the whole thing to finally deal a mortal blow to the Duke.And so the story begins. I just barely scratch the surface of it as it deals with a lot of intrigues, politics, religion issues, secret societies, survival on the planet which never saw a single drop of rain and where the wealth is counted in the amount of water owned. The most importantly, this is a story about the danger of creating a hero prophet.The book was originally published in 1965 and it does show its age, especially in the light of countless other books it inspired with the quality of the latter ranging from really pale imitations to great pieces of literature in their own way. I would not even call it a work of science fiction in the modern definition of the world. A relatively new term ""sword and planet"" would be a better genre description for it.I already mentioned the inspirations and imitations of the book. The reason for them is a very detailed world which looks completely unlike ours, yet is so similar to it. More importantly, it feels alive with its own landscapes, culture, religion, people, their rivalries and friendships. The worldbuilding is top-notch easily holding its own against undisputed king of that in fantasy, Middle Earth.The characters and their development are different story though. The only character who feels completely 3-dimensional with a good development is Paul Atreides, the Duke's son. I can somewhat agree that Jessica almost - but not completely - qualifies. The rest of the characters feel like cardboard cutouts, even the most important ones like Stilgar. As to the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen: he looks like an absolutely static caricature with practically all imaginable bad human indulgences thrown into to make him look completely repulsive.The strengths of the book easily overweight the weakness I mentioned before; the latter can be easily overlooked. The book became a victim to its own hype: it does not deserve the title of the most important and the best science fiction work ever which it is often credited with. Due to all the hype I am a little disappointed - enough to lower its rating by half a star. This review is a copy/paste of my BookLikes one: http://gene.booklikes.com/post/897366..."
Dune,4,"

“there is no escape — we pay for the violence of our ancestors.”

a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away…dune is widely regarded as the progenitor of the (modern) sci-fi genre. mixing the political intrigue of feudalism with philosophy, environmentalism, and a classic hero’s journey, the story centers on the atreides family as they journey to one of the most fought-over planets in the galaxy: arrakis.this desert planet is hostile in every meaning of the word: in its harsh climate and dangerous fauna, its native population of tough-as-nails fremen, and in the presence of atreides’ rival house harkonnen. all are factors that pose a risk to atreides’ control of the planet.thanks to an omniscient narrator, we’re keenly aware of any character’s thoughts and motivations throughout the story. our main protagonists, however, are undoubtedly paul atreides, a 15-year-old boy rumored to be a child of prophecy, and lady jessica, paul’s mother, a powerful leader with superhuman abilities that she’s also taught to her son.a lot of elements of this story will feel like known classics. we witness paul’s growth from boy to man as he accepts the mantle of leadership, and passes several tests of adulthood. not only his family and his father’s trusted lieutenants act as his teachers, but so does the planet itself. we know he’s gotta stumble and fall before he can take his rightful place as his father’s heir.however, i was very pleasantly surprised by the level of sophistication in the themes that herbert weaves into the story: profit versus environmentalism (see also: a metaphor for oil) with a side-serving of ecology and terraforming, the possibly violent combination of mysticism/religion and politics, and the level of manipulation that’s often required to move about in a rigid world like that of dune.it’s a constant give and take, though, which i thought permeated every single aspect of the story. one or two things are really, really cool and then whatever accompanies those things is decidedly not cool.let’s take the characters. where paul and jessica feel like very complete, flawed, and complex characters, a lot of the others are like… it’s not even cardboard. hot air, then? i mean, we have a fat, gay, pedophile antagonist, for god’s sake. and paul’s love interest is just there for only that.same goes for cultural aspects: the way the fremen culture is fully based on the preservation of water, working its way into language and customs and misunderstandings, is amazingly immersive. but then the rest of their ways are just a very obvious, butchered rip-off of a westernized perception of the imazigen, the indigenous people of north africa (with some buddhist-esque sayings thrown in).then there’s the rigidity of the patriarchal aspects of the galaxy’s feudalist society: we see lady jessica defy them and play around them in a myriad of clever, powerful ways that establish her agency and her ability to function beyond any sexist female archetypes. sure, she might’ve birthed a messianic figure, but she’s a smart political advisor and she can whoop any warrior’s ass because she’s a superb fighter, too.and yet all the other women in the story are either (1) background fodder, (2) making babies, (3) thinking about making babies so bloodlines can be manipulated in a very creepy eugenics way, or (4) servant, concubine, wife or pleasure slave.meanwhile, paul is out there literally defying the rigid view (and conflation) of sex and gender to a point where the subtext argues he’s neither man nor woman, but all the other characters remain firmly entrenched in their subscribed roles (which is easy, here: man = battle, woman = birth).and oh, arrakis, you were done dirty too. a hostile desert planet with something as amazing as sandworms! and spice, the product that shapes galaxy-wide profit systems and changes the very fabric of the people consuming it. and yet the book never seems to move beyond Generic Sandy Places and has a complete lack of engaging descriptions. (view spoiler)[i also can’t believe i got baited by such a cool terraforming plot and then it NEVER happened. shame on you, herbert! (hide spoiler)]see what i mean? it’s inevitable: in this book, you cannot have your cake and eat it, too. do you want to have a cool thing? sure, but you’ll also have to accept a very uncool thing alongside it. so whether you’ll enjoy this book probably depends on how well you can stomach the free bad stuff herbert is handing out alongside his interesting concepts.but when it’s good, it’s Pretty Damn Good. the quotability of this book is off the charts. philosophically, there’s so many interesting discussions going on about identity, responsibility, revenge, defying existing systems. and unlike most reviewers out here, i actually loved the dialogue -- which is great, because that’s about 80% of the book.(the other 20% are cursory descriptions, prophetic visions, and terrible action scenes.)the impact of this book cannot be denied. does it have problems? yes. myriads. the orientalism and white savior stuff probably being some of the worst offenders. did i still have an unexpectedly good time reading it, which might have been tinted by my nostalgia glasses? also yes.i like tortured heroes and women who are so confident in themselves that they’re like, fuck you, i’m powerful enough to create the messiah so i will. i like it when bad guys get stabbed and when scientists have beautiful, romantic dreams about terraforming.at the end of the day, this book is kinda like star wars, but with more substance. or wait, is it the other way around -- and star wars is like dune, but with less substance…? either way, both have more than enough sand.✎ 4.0 stars."
Dune,1,"I am so glad I finally fulfilled my half of the bet. This book was so dumb it was a chore to get through it--and I haven’t pushed past the pain period in years. People riding worms, killing their grandpas, weird names for knives, bullets and don’t forget, everyone is addicted to Cinnamon. I thought it was lame. It felt really juvenile. The author seemed to be trying really hard to make everything really mysterious and mythical, and all I could think was how lame it was: all-blue eyes, a worms called a ""makers,"" suits where you drink your own body moisture (disgusting). I'm also annoyed that this book was read in exchange for Pride and Prejudice. Compared with a timeless classic the book seems like a 1st grade primer. Austen is a master of plot and suspense. You may not like the subject matter, admittedly it is a little girlie, but the woman can write. Herbert? Not even close."
Dune,3,"3.5 stars
""I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer.""
Another buddy read with the awesomest of friends, TS, Emma and Celeste, is done!Turns out we need not have rushed to read this one before the movie, but in hindsight, this writing was on the wall. As for the story, I went into this not expecting to enjoy it much, and I was pleasantly surprised, at least for a while.Dune is of course, much loved and very well known as a staple of the science fiction genre and reading this for the first time I can very much see why. The story turned about to be a bit of a page turner, up to a point, filled with themes of power, control, religion, politics and family, all wrapped up in a intriguing promised one type plot with some excellent world-building and fascinating characters. And while I can easily say that Dune has stood the test of time and I am happy to have read it, my excitement for the story got lost a bit in all the philosophy and the weirder moments in the book, and lastly the ending which left quite a bit to be desired. All in all a very enjoyable read though."
Dune,2,"I've loved science fiction my whole life, but I was finally told that I couldn't call myself a SF fan if I hadn't read Dune. So I read it. I know Dune is worshipped as a paragon of groundbreaking SF, I can witness and acknowledge Herbert's genius, and I can understand that when it was written it was certainly seminal, but I still don't think much of it.Aside from Herbert's horribly annoying use of 3rd-person-omnipotent viewpoint, he's just not a good writer. For clarification: he's a fantastic story-teller and creator. He has an incredible imagination and a talent for world-building and interweaving complex storylines. But the actual craft of writing, well, he just can't write worth 2 beans. As a result, I found Dune nearly impossible to get through.Story-wise, I got bored with all the political stuff because it's not my thing, and I got bored with all the preaching about ecology. But I loved the elements that dealt more closely with the human drama, the personal choices characters make, their interactions with others, how they cope internally with themselves and their own strengths and weaknesses. Those are the stories I like. There was enough of that here to make me check out the sequel from the library, but after about 10 pages of Herbert's writing I just couldn't stomach any more."
Dune,3,"3ish stars.Impressive, epic, creative, revolutionary, classic, not for me. The sort of politics-heavy, languidly-paced, intellectually-stimulating beast that my mind respects more than my emotions connect with. I don't know what it is about this book in particular that I never clicked with because I've loved other dense, cerebral, worldbuilding sci-fi books that are similar thematically, and this is sort of the granddaddy of them all. I think part of it is that I never became fully invested in the characters. I also felt like I was working too hard for it to be the transportive, escapist masterpiece I was expecting. During much of the middle I would frequently find myself thinking ""I'd rather just watch the movie condensed to only the best bits than spend so much time here."" I realize that's blasphemy to most book enthusiasts, and fans of this book in particular. Whoops. But let me tell you, I am pumped about the new movie adaptation coming out later this year! I think director Denis Villneuve (Arrival, Blade Runner 2049) is a genius so providing the screenwriters (including Eric Roth of Forrest Gump and Benjamin Button) get it right and it's edited tightly, it has the potential to be the Dune I've been hoping for.Posted in Mr. Philip's Library"
Dune,1,"I read a few years ago that if you've not found Dune of your own accord by the time you've got to marriageable age, you're probably not a Dune sort of person. I'm sorry, you guys, I've let the side down. 320 pages, and I'm forced to conclude that Paul Atreides and I were never meant to be.When I admitted this to the lender of the book last night, he said some combination of ""ehh, your loss""/""BUT THE WORLDBUILDING"". And that's the thing, worldbuilding alone isn't enough for me. I felt this way about Perdido Street Station when I read it the year before last - the worldbuilding was fabulous, and similarly intricate. But I am the sort of person who enjoys shadow puppetry, who can be given a very few details, and is happy to hang the world off those and concentrate on the action. When you have that almost suffocatingly intricate worldbuilding - and yes, it is very impressive! and so is Miéville's in PSS - then you have passed the point where I can picture it, and you are headed very much towards making me claustrophobic. Dune made me feel claustrophobic, and I didn't like it. I appreciate it for the nods I've seen to it in other media - I bet Jack Glass would be even better now, there's such clear homage to it - especially in terms of the economic system. I'm really happy Frank Herbert did this thing. I just wish he'd done it somewhere else.And the rest feels old to me; it feels stale. It feels like A Christmas Carol when you've seen everyone and the Muppets do their own variations on it. It's like Dracula, terribly self-important and a genre forerunner, but with nothing that still feels fresh, all this time later. I'm glad, of course, that Dracula was written, but mostly because it paved the way for some fantastic things that came after it and because of it. It feels like a piece of backstory, something for the vampire completists. Dune also feels like that.I don't care about Paul, who is a haughty special snowflake, and with whom I can't identify. I don't care about his mother. We wouldn't be friends. There are a few characters I feel the flicker of rooting for (and ""Duncan Idaho"" is the best war hero name I've ever heard). I lost patience with Baron Von Terrible in less than a page. I don't like Arrakis, I wouldn't like to go there. So I don't feel any compulsion towards Dune for its characters' sake, much less its place in sci-fi canon.It's really odd to me, because I want to like hard sci-fi, and I think I like its defining characteristics, its direction and its outlook. Those things are all fascinating. But in a similar way, I like the characteristics and outlook of a lot of romance novels. With both sci-fi and romance, though, if I can't care for the characters, if I can't get excited about the plot, if I can't read the damn prose without something clenching in my stomach, then everything is ruined, no matter how good the idea is.It's strange, I had a similar feeling about a decade ago with Pride and Prejudice, which I later came back to and discovered was a revelation. So all is not completely lost. But in the meantime, Dune, I'm sorry. It's not you, it's me. But also it's you. We just don't have anything to say to each other.(P.S. I don't root for people with concubines. I don't, and you can't make me.)"
Dune,1,"I'm probably going to make whoever reads this review angry, but oh well.Whenever I ask anyone what sci-fi novels I should read, they always say ""Have you read Dune?!"" And then their body is found two weeks later at the bottom of a lake.This book . I don't usually come out and give such brutally negative reviews, but my god. If I ruled the world, I would ban this book for the sheer sake of how awful it is.People say Tolkien's prose was a struggle to read through, but at least his style of writing was intentionally made to be fashioned after an Arthurian epic. Frank Herbert just writes like a... Hell, I dont even know what he writes like. You could put a million monkeys in front of a million typewriters and have them hammer keys until the end of time, and the monkey who wrote this would look at the abomination he had created and throw himself off a cliff. Frank Herbert didn't even have the shame to do that.The pacing, the characters, the overall plotline, the miraculous events that seem to happen at just the right time, the awful dialogue, and the Mary Sue that is Paul Atreides simply boggles the mind.I read this book because I thought there must be some redeeming quality somewhere at the end. Some glorious stroke of genius that somehow rescues the story from the fiery hell that is Frank H's staggeringly atrocious storytelling. But there wasn't. It ended, and that was several hours of my life I would never get back.I exaggerated this review a lot more than was necessary for my own entertainment. But it's no lie that I had more fun writing this review than reading this book. -1/5. "
Dune,3,"Dune is one of those sci-fi novels where you get hit by a stream of dense, exotic-sounding coinages and no explanations about where we are or what's happening. It reads like there was a prologue which was removed before publication. Our hero, Paul Atreides, is also known as Muad'dib, and having endured the gom jabbar may be the Kwisatz Haderach foretold by the Bene Geserrit as well as the Lisan al-Gaib predicted by the ijaz of the Fremen, otherwise known as Usul in his home sietch…etc.The exposition can be a little clunky at times, too. How's this for subtly introducing the identity of a new character:‘Is it not a magnificent thing that I, the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, do?’To which my initial reaction was: Is it not a shit thing that I, the reviewer Warwick Wise, read? Nevertheless, there is a certain charm to it all, the characters are a lot more than cardboard cutouts, and the world-building, prefiguring everything from Star Wars to Game of Thrones, is complex and excellent.The story itself is a very classical hero-narrative (deliberately so – Herbert was a big fan of Joseph Campbell), which moves slowly but has all kinds of interesting details. Perhaps surprisingly, it felt to me like a real product of the 60s in many ways, with a central role given to mind-altering substances and an important ecological theme – the book is dedicated to ‘dry-land ecologists’. (Dune was popularised among the countercultural community after being included in Stuart Brand's Whole Earth Catalog, in a completely unexpected link with my other recent reading.) But all of these factors also make it quite relevant today, not least the depiction of a religiously fanatical desert community being exploited for the hugely profitable substance found by drilling into the sands. Those are all just added extras, though – if you don't enjoy the prospect of a big, sprawling political science-fiction saga then you're not going to get much out of the various subplots.This Folio Society edition is kind of gorgeous, featuring these absolutely exquisite illustrations from Sam Weber, as well as a badly-written afterword from Brian Herbert which does not incline me to read the later sequels he wrote from his father's notes. I probably should have read this twenty years ago, but I'd still consider it a good, foundational piece of sci-fi, which sheds light on several aspects of the tradition and can still be enjoyed plenty for its own sake. And now, a naked slave-girl:"
Dune,1,"My favourite memory of this book is when I was reading along, thoroughly hating everything, and then the book abruptly ended fifty pages before I was expecting it to because it turns out the rest of it is all appendices.I don't even know where to begin reviewing this book, although the rant I launched into on Tumblr taught me I had many things to say. Perhaps I was doomed to dislike this book when I started at page one and discovered that its two main characters were named Paul and Jessica. Still, I moved past that; I'd heard this book was good, I was going to persevere. Then on page 20 or so Paul was obnoxious and sexist and I got frustrated. And then, it has to be said, Paul never really did anything to redeem himself for being generally obnoxious. Mostly he just oscillated between continuing to be obnoxious and being some all-seeing, all-knowing dispenser of wisdom and neither of those personas was particularly endearing.Honestly, I was annoyed for a lot of the book that Paul had all of these special mental abilities that supposedly had never been had by men before, only women, and Paul was such an arrogant twerp anyway that I strongly disliked him being some kind of Chosen One. I felt that Frank Herbert was going to have this rule that only women can have these powers, the character of Paul should have been a woman then. But then it seems that the entire point of the plot is that he IS the first man to have this abilities - the Kwisatz Haderach or however it's supposed to be spelt - so then I guess it just annoyed me that there was this deep gender essentialism in something that should not have anything to do with gender at all (the innate abilities of the brain...).Aside from that! This book also had approximately 9658976897579668 male characters who I couldn't tell the difference between. Towards the end there some guy named Guernsey or something turned up and supposedly he was Paul's friend from way back but I had no clue who he was and nor was I entirely sure I was supposed to. The female characters who existed seemed mostly interested in basking in the glory of Paul (probably he had a halo or something too, idk). Chani was nothing more than his love interest. That woman he won (as property) by killing Jamis was the same. Alia barely even did anything. Jessica was by far the most developed of the female characters, but even she was really disappointing because literally everyone spent the entire book talking about what a threat she posed to Paul and like, no, she didn't in any way whatsoever. PAUL HIMSELF at one point identified Jessica as his ""true enemy"" and well, I guess he's not all-seeing and all-knowing after all because that was LITERALLY NEVER FOLLOWED UP ON. All she did was disapprove of his relationship with Chani because she's an utter snob and disapproved of him seeing a ""desert girl"". Wow. I'm shaking in my boots, Jessica.There are some defences to be made of this book - for instance, Herbert was obviously not trying to write about anything other than a deeply sexist society, so the fact that women get treated as property and evaluated in terms of their marriageability is not a flaw of the writer so much as the deeply annoying society he invented. Nonetheless, there were not enough female characters and those characters that did exist were not strong enough to counteract this. But then again, the male characters weren't very strong either, hence why I mixed them all up, so... really...Anyway, I was dithering about whether to give this book two stars or three (mostly because I'd heard it was so good and I thought I'd judged it unfairly just because of the names-of-the-characters thing making me hostile from the off). BUT THEN I READ THE LAST PAGE.NO JOKE, the last page is about how Paul has to marry this Princess Irulan to secure peace across the kingdoms or something but NO WORRIES because he's going to treat Princess Irulan like a worthless piece of shit forever because his true love is Chani! And Jessica is really pleased about this because she no longer hates Chani and she apparently thinks Princess Irulan deserves to live a life of misery because, y'know, she dared to be born a woman into a family that would force her into an arranged marriage and that is definitely all her fault.Seriously, I hate you Jessica.And basically everyone in this book, really. I guess Chani was okay, if not very well developed. Also the woman Paul won off Jamis, she was sassy, except I forgot her name so I guess not that sassy.In conclusion...This book is hyped beyond all proportion. I didn't understand it and it annoyed me but if you like long books with irritating and indistinguishable characters, go for your life.(EDIT: I decided to demote this book from two stars to one star, because I actually really hated it so two stars was bizarrely generous. I don't remember anything I liked about this book. Don't read it.)"
Dune,3,"BR with my Emma's Party  friends (:-----------------------Liz against the world's rating: 3.9 Stars Look at me, here I am reading Hugo's winner Dune 50 years after its publication and living to tell the tale. Dune is, without doubt, a groundbreaking story with a complex and enthralling universe. The concept of Dune is exhilarating: sandworms, a messiah, the Fremen and their spice. The actual reading, however, is a slightly less perfect experience.Princess Irulan states from the beginning that precocious Paul is not only meant for greatness, he's already a Legend. So Dune is not much about Paul struggling to believe he's the One as it is about Paul in his heroic journey fighting his fate: the unstoppable Fremen jihad he so much wants to avoid. We can see him time after time refusing to be what his prescience has showed him. And on that note, there's a lot of Dune that you know from the beginning because foreshadowing is the key word. The funny thing is, Herbert keeps telling the story as if you haven't already been warned. (view spoiler)[Leto's death, Harkonen's attack, Paul as leader of the Fremen, Muad'Dib AND Kwisatz Haderach. (hide spoiler)]When you talk about Dune, you have to admit the world-building is flawless but when it comes to character development, time-skip is its biggest enemy and mine: I'm a characters reader. And even if the characters were on spot most of the time, Herbert insisted on laying out their inner thoughts instead of actual dialogs which was incredibly annoying. There is little to no characterization maybe because Herbert indulges his interest in ecology, political philosophy, religion and the messianic quest more than anything else which, if I understand correctly, is perfectly okay for the genre. I didn't get to see the actual development of the characters and so there was a lot of guessing for me: about Fremen as a society, Paul and Chani's relationship, his son, and more. Herbert chooses to leave you in the dark most of the time and when answers come, they're scarce and unsatisfying. So you keep reading! It's a page turner, alright, but because you're in painful need to make sense of the story. And you kinda love it, honestly. Despite all this, I'm completely captivated by Herbert's creative world. I couldn't get enough of Paul's ability to see present, past and future as a now, the pseudo-technology, the Bene Gesserit and of course, the spice and its properties to name a few.All in all, it was a great book and I enjoyed a lot of it even if I fought with Herbert through the whole experience. I'm not sure if I'll keep up with the series, though, but I'm sure fans of the genre will absolutely love this. Mind-blowing art by Mark Molnar "
Dune,3,"

“I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.”
 Dune can be easily listed as one of the most difficult books, that I have ever read. Under the guise of a science fiction, this book can easily be classified as a treatise on existentialism, philosophy, politics, region, war manual(?) I honestly don't have the capability to ""review"" this cult classic.My only dilemma is how to rate this book?Should I rate this magnum opus for its sheer brilliance? the extent of themes and issues that his book deals with? all the philosophical discourse that forms an inherent core of the story? Or should I rate this book for the author's imagination for giving us this story, progressive to such an extent that it wont grow old even if one reads it in the next decade or four?But, how do I reconcile to the fact that I hated the protagonist right from the very beginning? No matter how much I tried, I never warmed up to him. Nevertheless, the other characters kind of made up for my irritation towards him.Will I read the sequel? No, not yet. Why? Tbh, I didn't even get half the things, that this one set out to portray. There are so many subtle, hidden nuances within this book, I need to read it again and again, to fully understand it.So a 3.25- I-am-in-awe-and-equally-humbled-with-this-book-starsP.S.: I partially read the book and part listened to the audio. The audio production requires a special mention here. Its one of  T.H.E. B.E.S.T. audio books I've read till date."
Dune,3,"As kids, my older brother was a Dune guy, whereas I bowed at the altar of John Ronald Reuel—and neither of us could ever bring ourselves to meet fully in the other's territory. I have tried Frank Herbert's renowned series several times now but have yet to make it further than Dune Messiah, the succinct, but inferior, follow-up to his smash-hit series opener. Everything that constitutes this curiously prescient science-fiction champion appeals to me: an alluringly thoughtful and flush aeon-spanning back story; a desert planet from which is harvested the priceless spice that allows interplanetary travel; feuding and scheming noble houses within a middle-eastern-flavored interstellar Empire; human computers and gaberdine sects that have replaced forbidden machines; the super-cool Sardaukar, the soldier-fanatics of the regnant Padishah-Emperor; the young Duke with mysterious portents and genetic mysteries interwoven about his young stud self and his formidable mystic mother, and so on and so forth. It's all there for something to scratch all those itches and stoke all those fires and hoist itself up onto the same level as Tolkien's epic saga.Except that it didn't.Every time that I have returned to read this novel, I marvel at how much the first two-thirds suck me in, ramping up the tension and tautening the various strands of the conspiracy-bound story—and the introduction of the Fremen and their austere, feral, and ritualized Neo-Bedouin culture developed amidst an endlessly severe and brutal wasteland is the most brilliant component of this story that has several. And every time I can't believe that Herbert put all of that thought and imagination and effort into this puppy only to sink it with that terribly rushed and anti-climactic ending. With whiplash haste the Baron is toast, his nephew is skewered, the Emperor is debased, the Sardaukar humbled, the Fremen ascendant, and Paul Atreides the smiling blue-eyed boy of the moment. It's the same undue haste and how-in-the-hell-do-I-wrap-this-up? palmball that he uses to hopelessly mar the ending of the already flawed Dune Messiah. The tangled plots and machinations and generational maneuvering and betrayals and...THE END! PLOTS UNRAVELED! BAD GUYS SMOKED! BLAME PLACED ON MEDDLING KIDS NOTED! NEXT!It's quite obvious that I'm in the miniscule minority here—and I've heard similarly vehement complaints in a reverse manner from my brother concerning the good Professor—but the palpable disappointment I feel at what I consider Herbert's lamentable inability to finish a novel at near the same level with which he constructs the back story and fleshes out the opening sections becomes so intense that it bums me right the hell out. What's more, with nearly every reader warning me that the series gets progressively more obscure and turgid the further down the chain of sequels one ventures, I have never mustered the will to crack the spine of Children of Dune, let alone the infamous God Emperor. Ah, Frank, you brilliant innovator and miscegenetic culture breeder, how magical it could have been if only you had the moxie to finish what you started."
Dune,2,"1st reread (also a buddy read with the World Beyond Margins group) in 2019I can't even finish this thing in a reread. Part 1 now annoyed me a lot (Paul was an unbearable Gary Stu, I hate Bene Gesserit, fatshaming an already gross villain, dichotomy on women with logic etc etc) Oh indeed my older self became more critical compared to my first read (see below three-star review back in 2009). Even though I knew the ending I just do not want to experience 300 pages more of this, even though I did like the Fremen. But the question is that do I really want to spend precious time reading about all the things above, added with the 'legal concubine' stuff? DNFed at page 210. One star dropped. Many books await me. Bubye!Original review (2009):I liked the idea offered from this book. The adventure and the sci-fi elements were definitely promising. The planet and the ways of living of the people to cope with the harsh environment were interesting. Too bad, the characterization plus some of the plots were not according to my taste. Some were killed off too fast, the others were...well,simply boring and predictable. The first part was awesome (edit: or was it?), the second and the third lost me. The final battle did not offer the highest dramatic tension as hoped. Plus, I found the philosophical nuances (and whatnot) a bit tiring. I wanna see more action, for Verne's sake! To complete my rambling here: I got the feeling that this book is somewhat misogynistic. Not only because I don't like reading books with concubines in it, mind you.But hey, since I appreciated the ideas offered, I'm still gonna give it a three-star rating. Doesn't mean I'm gonna read it the second time in the near future though."
Dune,2,"What has mood to do with it? You fight when the necessity arises—no matter the mood! Mood's a thing for cattle or making love or playing the baliset. It's not for fighting.My problems with Dune are not issues with speculation. My disbelief is maintained through healthy exercise. Much as I am opposed to terms like world-building I can empathize and imagine. Pondering alternatives is a heady philosophical endeavor. That said, I do not like the insistence on the epic in SF/F. What I want is a Month in The Country or a Stoner on some distant world. Maybe that is why Dhalgren and Embassytown hold such appeal. I read the first 300 pages in a rush. I noted that it was the cast of Hamlet involved in the Battle of Lepanto and deciding to stage a production of Othello. Along the way Ned Stark becomes a suicide bomber. Matters sort of went downhill from there. I didn’t pick up the book for a few weeks and then blew through the remaining 200 pages in two days. Lawrence of Arabia imbibes a magic elixir and becomes Harry Potter and the womenfolk just hope for the proper man, both in prophetic terms as well as totems of identity and fulfillment. Wooden dialogue muddied a clever use of stream-of-consciousness. Alejandro Jodorowsky was an ultimate influence on my reading. His unrealized cinematic adaptation was a superior vision to what was committed to paper by Herbert. Here's to my pledge that the inchoate will never be terraformed. "
Dune,1,"Terrible. To write a book, you should be able to do at least one of the following:1) Develop characters2) Tell an interesting story3) Write dialogue that vaguely resembles what someone might say4) Write sentences that might be interesting to a readerInstead, we are left with:1) One dimensional characters2) Plot summary: Talking, massacre, talking, religious ceremony, talking, man rides a worm, talking, massacre, talking, knife fight. Ta-da!3) Melodrama!4) Cliches!This might have made a passable movie, or video game, or commercial, or perhaps theme for children's lunchboxes. But a book is based on writing! You have to be a writer to write a book. I can't stress this enough. It's like saying that the violinist was out of tune, had no bow control or rhythm, couldn't remember the music, and the interpretation was hackneyed, but at least his pants were nice. The writing was egregious. All the ""exciting action"" was confusing, from sandworm riding to knife fights. Third person omnipotent, a shortcut to drama if I've ever seen it, was poorly executed. And the melodrama! Sweet Christ of Mercy no one ever said anything funny or guarded or nuanced or tender. Characters emotions were delivered as if Keanu Reeves was playing each part. Oh the humanity! The only thing that propelled me to finish the blasted thing was my hate for it."
Dune,2,"Woo, I conquered the Dunes, crossed the sands without being eaten by a worm, and inhaled the aromatic spices of Arrakis. This is a victory, even if Dune turned out not to be my sort of science fiction. I know, I know, it's a classic and I'm meant to love it, and I'm an utter disappointment to my parents, who dearly love the early Dune books. Oh well, such is life, no? I can see why Dune is so popular, but, largely, it's just not the sort of book I can love, though I'm very glad to have read it, so thank you to Robbie for getting me to do so!Time and again, I've said that I am a character reader, and I'm sure I'll set many more times. Dune has many charms, but they are not of characterization. Most of the cast is just so focused on one thing at all times, on ruling or backstabbing or mothering or being a wife or whatever. They're largely not people of interests outside of what they need to survive. Everything is about the world building and the political landscape. This isn't a book of banter and bonding. If world building delights you even without strong characterization, by all means, come explore these sand dunes.At times, though, Dune did flirt with being a book I could like overall. The story of Paul Atreides doing a sort of Monte Cristo and rising up for vengeance with a whole bunch of power at his back is pretty awesome. The powers exhibited by Paul and the Bene Gesserit, women trained to have crazy fighting skills and more, are fascinating. I'm also curious about Arrakis and how this planet exists. How can a planet with so little water sustain life (by drinking their bodily fluids and those of others for one thing O_O)? What precisely is the spice and how does it relate to the worms?These elements that I liked, though, were bogged down in the political back and forth, the perspective hopping between those of the Atreides group and the antagonists. I just had no fucks to give about what the Harkonnens or the Emperor were doing. Paul so obviously has all the power in the world and has been fulfilling all of these prophecies to be the Kwisatz Haderach, whatever that really means, so it's not like he's going to be defeated. It's sort of like how Harry Potter obviously wasn't going to die in Rowling's series. It's hard to care about Paul when I know he won't be killed.Oh, though I'm not generally a big fan of characters being that powerful and perfect, I do like the way Herbert showed the difficulties of being Paul. He clearly struggles with the apartness of being so much more than everyone around him. The fact that he receives reverence rather than friendship further alienates him from the rest of humanity. This in turn makes it more likely that he will turn corrupt or unfeeling, as was oft hinted.What really held me back in Dune more than anything else was the writing. It's not a style I found pleasing. Herbert uses a close third person, which jumps about from character to character. On top of that, character's thoughts are in italics. For the most part, that's alright, but sometimes there were long paragraphs of fragmented thoughts separated by ellipses. Between each chapter, unmarked stretches of time pass, leaving me constantly disoriented when I pick the book back up. Little details are dealt with endlessly but the climax skips most of the fighting for more talking. So many people die in Dune, and yet there's so little actual action.Also worthy of note is that the treatment of women in the novel made me uncomfortable, as well as the treatment of the Fremen. Women can obviously be quite strong, stronger than the men, as the Bene Gesserit show. However, that's not a feminist move if these powerful women are essentially slaved, sold out as concubines to wealthy men. Plus, there's a weird message that being a concubine is actually better than a wife that I find really puzzling.The Fremen are the desert people of Arrakis, who know much better how to survive there, and rule the planet no matter what Duke claims to be the leader. They're way better fighters than anyone else, and they do get respect for that. Still, I find the fact that they need Paul, from outside their culture, to come in and rule them disgusting. It's like this is pro-colonization, and I am not a fan.That all came out quite ranty, but I really don't think Dune is a terrible book. It's not a great book for me, since I'm not all that interested in political intrigue or world building for its own sake. Dune's also very much a product of it's time. Glad to have read it so I know what the fuss is about, but I shan't be continuing on, which is probably for the best since I heard the series goes bad places."
Dune,2,"I picked this book up at last thanks to my buddy reading group as it was the book which was voted for us to read in December. I have to say I didn't know a great deal about Dune before going into it other than that it had big sand worms things and was considered a 'classic' in the SF genre. I think not knowing much about it meant that I assumed it would be something very different to what it was. In my opinion this whole story felt a bit like a weird mash-up between the sci-fi setting and different races/planets and a very fantastical magical prophetic situation and story. When I entered into this I thought we'd be seeing a lot more of a focus on the science and technology, but actually this was more driven by betrayal and magic and politics, which was interesting, but far from what I think many would have envisioned.With that said, I think that had I known it was more of a sci-fi/fantasy mash-up going into it I might have enjoyed it more. I do think that the political undercurrents that we see being laid out at the start are pretty well handled and interesting, and that our main character, Paul, is a fairly unique character right away. My main criticism was that prophecy is always something which can easily become a 'get out of jail free' card and can be used to 'conveniently' fix things or make things happen, and I did think that this book suffered a bit for that.The book is set on a desert planet where there are lots of massive sand Dunes and very little hospitable areas for plants or life. Water is a very rare commodity and most people on the planet haven't got enough of it and so it's largely used by workers to harvest and tend to a special kind of spice which is grown there. We follow the Duke and his lover, Jessica, and son, Paul who are told to look after and watch over the planet by the Emperor at the start of the story and so they fly there with the intention of doing so but quickly become ensnared in the games and plots which are already in motion. As it goes on Paul and Jessica become the two major focuses as they are both highly trained, have gifts and seem to be fairly independent and intelligent. On the whole I think that seeing the Fremen and their culture living on the water-deprived planet was some of the most interesting sections for me. The Worms didn't appear anywhere near as much as I though they would, and yet they were pretty important to the plot at some points. I think that the story suffered a little from too much prophecy and peculiar magic trying to fit into a modern and desolate SF landscape. It could have been a much more cohesive plot had this been a little less or more subtle. Overall I would give this a 2*s because it's an okay book and it's certainly not that hard to get into and read, but at no point was I truly fascinated or enjoying it more than anything else I have read recently. It's a book which has a plot that I found somewhat exciting at points and not at all at others, and had character who were interesting at moments, and irritating at others. It's hailed as a classic SF book and yet I think maybe by modern immersion standards it didn't quite hold up for me... 2*s overall."
Dune,2,"I think teenage me would have liked this a lot more.I can see why this is a classic. It has a really vivid world, an epic plot, and some of the descriptions of the desert are truly beautiful. So that's where these two stars come from.But....there's also a lot that absolutely rubbed me the wrong way. (view spoiler)[- the gender politics: women are there to be wives or concubines (or servants that have some kind of plot function). Even the Bene Gesserit, with all their famed training, are basically just there to bear children. And with the hints that it's possible to implant ""commands"" into peoples' minds, who's to say all these women aren't similarly manipulated in some way. I find that thought very unsettling. And don't get me started on the whole ""men are takers and women are givers"" thing. Paul's assertion ""He who can destroy a thing has the real control of it"" is very revealing on a number of levels, not only where gender roles are concerned.- the Eugenics: that seems to mostly be a Bene Gesserit thing, and while Paul speaks of their schemes with some derision, he (in all his glory) is also a product of those schemes. I obviously don't know if the later books come out against this more forcefully but still. It's a yikes from me.- the imperialism: clearly, an Empire is a good thing in this book as long as a ""good"" person sits on the throne. What made me especially uncomfortable where the ""Missionaria Protectiva"" implanted on colony worlds to help the Bene Gesserit plan along and the ""this random colonizer is actually as good (if not better) as the natives because 'destiny'"" aspect. - homo- and fatphobia: the villain is evil and a bad ruler and in case that wasn't made clear by his actions, let's make him a stereotypical gay villain and also grotesquely fat!e- Paul: Let's be real here. If this were a female protagonist, we'd keep hearing about how much of a Mary Sue she is. (hide spoiler)]"
Dune,1,"I know this book is HUGE in the science-fiction world and, now that I have read it, I am honestly not sure why. I do not think I ""got it"" the way so many others did. At the beginning I thought I was going to love it, but by the end I was disenchanted. Dune is an overworked, beaten-to-death plot. It had its moments where I could appreciate the characterizations, but all of that got lost in a sea of rambling. History makes the man as they say. We got it already.Also, there were moments were I was offended to be honest. For a futuristic society, women have very little by way of rights. I can hear the He-Man voices now, ""Woman! Be my baby machine! Rwar!"" Jessica was my hope for some really female butt-kicking in the beginning, but even she seemed silenced in the end. It is all about the politics and very little about the rights of humanity. Is this the point? Or are we actually supposed to like Paul and his political moves?As for the characters...Paul is a prat. He never had to work for anything he achieved as it all came to him so easily. Harry Potter he is not. He had sacrifices, but these really came from other people. Oh, and what was the point of Feyd Rautha? He seemed like such a useless character. What was the point of Alia?It was all rather pretentious. "
Dune,1,"Meh! Only finished this out of sheer stubbornness to get it over with. The entire thing is packed with tedious, overwrought dialogue. When you combine that with the incessant pointing out of the obvious, the whole thing reads like one heck of a boring lecture. There's really no intrigue here, this is mostly a collection of boring, self obsessive monologues by unlikeable characters. The author is fond of implying something and then to make sure the reader gets it, having another character internal monologue the explanation of the obvious implication. What rubbish!At some point a character, Kynes, rants at his father saying: Lecturing, lecturing, lecturing -always lecturing. This sentence sums up my feelings about this book!"
Dune,2,"The Best Buddy Un-Read with Silvana and Elena in WBtM!DNF @ 65%It's not even the fact that there's basically no levity in this book - I'm pretty sure Lord of the Rings is similar in that regard - but I just couldn't connect with any of the characters. I made it past the halfway mark and really just didn't care about what was happening. I liked Arrakis as far as world-building was concerned but Paul was insufferable. The Baron was cartoonish in his over-the-top villainy. Stilgar was mildly interesting but that was it. Jessica... I don't know quite what to say about her, except that partway in she stopped acting like a mother and started taking orders from her 15-year-old son, which, no.On the technical front, I'm frankly astounded that this audiobook won the Audie Award. It's touted as being narrated by Simon Vance, Scott Brick, Orlagh Cassidy, Euan Morton, and a full cast, but it's lies. It sounds like Simon narrated the full book (the poor man) and then they tossed everyone else in to do random voices at random points because WHO CARES IT'S DUNE SO IT'S CLEARLY AMAZING REGARDLESS OF WHAT WE DO. Those voices for the characters were not consistent and it bothered the hell out of me."
